I AM MOVED TO WRITE YOU THIS LETTER  THIS WAS IN CONFIDENCE  CONSIDERING MY PRESENTCIRCUMSTANCE AND SITUATION. I ESCAPED ALONG WITH MY HUSBAND AND TWO OF OUR SONS GEORGE  KONGOLO  AND BASHER  OUT OF DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO (DRC) TO ABIDJAN  COTE D'IVOIRE WHERE MY FAMILY AND I SETTLED  WHILE WE LATER MOVED  TO SETTLED IN MORROCO WHERE MY HUSBAND LATER DIED OF CANCER DISEASE. HOWEVER DUE TO THIS SITUATION WE DECIDED TO CHANGED  MOST OF MY HUSBAND'S BILLIONS OF DOLLARS DEPOSITED IN SWISS BANK AND OTHER COUNTRIES INTO OTHER FORMS OF MONEY CODED FOR  SAFE PURPOSE BECAUSE THE NEW HEAD OF STATE OF (DR) MR LAURENT  KABILA HAS MADE ARRANGEMENT WITH THE SWISS GOVERNMENT AND OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO FREEZE ALL MY LATE HUSBAND'S TREASURES  DEPOSITED IN SOME EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. HENCE MY CHILDREN AND I DECIDED LAYING LOW IN AFRICA TO STUDY THE SITUATION TILL  WHEN THINGS GETS BETTER  LIKE NOW THAT PRESIDENT KABILA IS DEAD AND THE SON TAKING OVER (JOSEPH KABILA). ONE OF MY LATE HUSBAND'S CHATEAUX IN SOUTHERN FRANCE WAS CONFISCATED  BY THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT  AND AS SUCH I HAD TO CHANGE MY IDENTITY  SO THAT MY INVESTMENT WILL NOT BE TRACED AND CONFISCATED. I HAVE DEPOSITED THE SUM EIGHTEEN MILLION UNITED STATE DOLLARS(US$18 000 000 00.)  WITH A SECURITY COMPANY   FOR SAFEKEEPING. THE  FUNDS ARE SECURITY CODED TO PREVENT THEM FROM KNOWING THE CONTENT. WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS TO INDICATE YOUR INTEREST THAT YOU WILL ASSIST US BY RECEIVING THE MONEY ON OUR BEHALF.ACKNOWLEDGE THIS MESSAGE  SO THAT I CAN INTRODUCE YOU TO MY SON (KONGOLO) WHO HAS THE OUT MODALITIES FOR THE CLAIM OF THE SAID FUNDS. I WANT YOU TO ASSIST IN INVESTING THIS MONEY  BUT I WILL NOT WANT MY IDENTITY REVEALED. I WILL ALSO WANT TO BUY PROPERTIES AND STOCK IN MULTI-NATIONAL COMPANIES AND TO ENGAGE IN OTHER SAFE AND NON-SPECULATIVE INVESTMENTS. MAY I AT THIS POINT EMPHASISE THE HIGH LEVEL OF CONFIDENTIALITY   WHICH THIS BUSINESS DEMANDS  AND HOPE YOU WILL NOT BETRAY THE TRUST AND CONFIDENCE  WHICH I REPOSE IN YOU. IN CONCLUSION   IF YOU WANT TO ASSIST US   MY SON SHALL PUT YOU IN THE PICTURE  OF THE BUSINESS  TELL YOU WHERE THE FUNDS ARE CURRENTLY BEING  MAINTAINED AND ALSO DISCUSS OTHER MODALITIES INCLUDING REMUNERATIONFOR YOUR SERVICES.

Let's also assume that  the mailingreceives only a 0.2% response (the response could be  muchbetter but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also  many  peoplewill send out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead ofonly  5 000 each).Continuing with this example  you send out only 5 000  e-mails.With a 0.2% response  that is only 10 orders for Report #1.Those  10 people resonded by sending out 5 000 e-mails eachfor a total of  50 000. Out of those 50 000 e-mails only 0.2%responded with  orders. That's 100 people responded andordered Report #2. Those  100 people mail out 5 000 e-mailseach for a total of 500 000 e-mails.  The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report #3.Thoe 1000  people send out 5 000 e-mails each for a total of5 million e-mails sent  out.

I made fun of thewhole thing   spouting my knowledge of the population andpercentages involved. I  ""knew"" it wouldn't work. Jodytotally ignored my supposed intelligence  and a few days latershe jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun  of her and was ready to lay the old ""I told you so"" on her whenthe thing  didn't work. Well  the laugh was on me! Within3 weeks she had  received 50 responses. Within the next 45days she had received a total  of $147 200.00 all cash!I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her  ""hobby"". Mitchell Wof  Chicago   Illinois----------------------------------------------------------------""Not  being the gambling type  it took me several weeks tomake up my mind to  participate in this plan. But conservativethat I am  I decided that  the initial investment was so littlethat there was just no way that I  wouldn't get enough ordersto at least get my money back. I was  surprised when I foundmy medium sized post office box crammed with  orders. I made$319 210.00 in the first 12 weeks.

My wife Jody and I  live in Chicago.I am an accountant with a major US Corporation and I  makepretty good money. When I received this program I grumbledto  Jody about receiving ""junk mail"". I made fun of thewhole thing   spouting my knowledge of the population andpercentages involved. I  ""knew"" it wouldn't work. Jodytotally ignored my supposed intelligence  and a few days latershe jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun  of her and was ready to lay the old ""I told you so"" on her whenthe thing  didn't work. Well  the laugh was on me! Within3 weeks she had  received 50 responses. Within the next 45days she had received a total  of $147 200.00 all cash!I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her  ""hobby"". Mitchell Wof  Chicago   Illinois----------------------------------------------------------------""Not  being the gambling type  it took me several weeks tomake up my mind to  participate in this plan. But conservativethat I am  I decided that  the initial investment was so littlethat there was just no way that I  wouldn't get enough ordersto at least get my money back. I was  surprised when I foundmy medium sized post office box crammed with  orders. I made$319 210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing  about thisdeal is that it does not matter where people live.  Theresimply isn't a better investment with a faster return andso  big"". Dan Sondstrom  Alberta   Canada---------------------------------------------------------------""I  had received this program before. I deleted it  but laterI wondered if  I should hav given it a try. Of course  Ihad no idea who to contact to  get another copy  so I had towait until I was e-mailed again by someone else  . . . . . . . 11 months passed then it luckily came again. I did not  delete this one! I made more than $490 000 on my first tryand all  the money came within 22 weeks"". Susan De  Suza  New York   NY--------------------------------------------------------------""It  really is a great opportunity to make relatively easymoney with little cost  to you. I followed the simpleinstructions carefully and within 10 days  the money startedto come in. My first month I made $20 560.00 and by  theend of the third month my total cash count was $362 840.00.Life is  beautiful  thanks to the Internet"".

Message-Id:  X-Mailer: Atlas Mailer 2.0 Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8 Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit  OWOLABI & ASSOCIATE  FALOMO  IKOYI. LAGOS - NIGERIA.   YOUR KIND ATTN.     RE: REQUEST FOR MUTUALLY BENEFITTING ENDEAVOUR.  I humbly crave your indulgence in sending you this mail  if the contents does not meet with your personal and business ethics  I apologize in advance.  I am Barrister Kola Owolabi( attorney at law)  I represent Alhaji Ishmaila Ibrahim Gwarzo’s estates. Alhaji Gwarzo was the chief security advicer of the then military leader of this country(Nigeria) in the person of Late General Sani Abacha who died on the 8th of June 1998. With the advent of a new democratic dispensation in the country under the leadership of Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo (Rtd)  my client has come under severe persecution due to the sensitive position he held in the last military regime  presently he is under house arrest restricted only to the confines of his village.  The main purpose of this mail is to intimate you of a business proposal that might be of interest to you. My client has informed me of the existence of funds deposited with a security company abroad. This fund came about as part of security votes that were allocated to my client's portfolio during his tenure as chief security adviser to the then president. What happened was that he had part of the funds transferred from the vaults of the Central Bank Of Nigeria to this security outfit with the aim of purchasing arms and ammunitions for the personal security outfit of the then president. But before the purchase could take place the president died. My client has decided to keep this for himself as all his properties has been confisticated by the present regime. But due to his incarceration he cannot travel out and effect the change of possession to his benefit.  I have been mandated by my client to source for a foreign partner that can help him facilitate the change of possession. The deposit certificate and the code needed for the execution of this endeavor are in my possession.  The funds in question is USD17.6M (Seventeen Million  Six Hundred Thousand United States dollars Only). Should this proposition be of interest to you  you can reach me through my e-mail address so that we can go through the rudiments of this endeavor.  I remain most obliged.  Barrister Kola Owolabi(JP). Principal Partner.

"Date: Sat  24 Aug 2002 20:18:02 -0700 Subject: Immediate Reply Needed X-Mailer: Microsoft Outlook Express 5.00.2919.6900 DM MIME-Version: 1.0 Content-Type: text/plain; charset=""us-ascii"" X-MIME-Autoconverted: from quoted-printable to 8bit by dogma.slashnull.org     id g7OHHcZ10961 Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit  Dear Sir   I am Dr James Alabi  the chairman of contract award and review committee set up by the federal government of Nigeria under the new civilian dispensation to award new contracts and review existing ones. I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction  which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account.   There were series of contracts executed by a  consortium of multi-nationals in the oil industry in favor of N.N.P.C. The original values of these  contracts were deliberately over invoiced to the sum of US$12 320 000.00 (Twelve Million Three Hundred and Twenty Thousand  United State Dollars). This amount has now been approved and is now ready to be transferred being that the companies that actually executed these contracts have been fully Paid and the projects officially commissioned.    Consequently  my colleagues and I are willing to  transfer the total amount to your account for subsequent disbursement  since we as civil servants are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau (civil service law) from operating and/or opening foreign  accounts in our names. Needless to say  the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous  in  return  we have agreed to offer you 20% of the  transferred sum  while 10% shall be set aside for incidental expenses (internal and external) between both parties in the course of the transaction you will be mandated to remit the balance to other accounts in due course.   Modalities have been worked out at the highest level of the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of  Nigeria for the immediate transfer of the funds within 7 working days subject to your satisfaction of the above stated terms.  Our assurance is that your role is risk free. To   accord this transaction the legality it deserves and for mutual security of the funds the whole approval procedures will officially and legally processed with your name or the name of any company you may nominate as the bonefide beneficiary.  Once more I want you to understand that having put in over twenty-five years in the civil service of my country  I am averse to having my image and career  dented. This matter should therefore be treated with utmost secrecy and urgency it deserves.   Please you should signify your intention to assist by sending me a reply to this email to state your position on this transaction  if favorable we will take further steps to brief you the full details of this viable  transaction.  I want to assure you that this business proposal is 100% risk free as we have done our homework properly.   I quite believe that you will protect our interest by taking this deal strictly confidential  as we are still in government service  which we intend to retire from in full honor.  Kindly expedite action as we are behind schedule to enable us include this transfer in the next batch which would constitute the new quarter payments for the 2002 financial year.   Thank you and God bless.  Dr James Alabi",1
"Date: Sun  25 Aug 2002 09:36:45 +0800 X-Mailer: Microsoft Outlook Express 6.00.2600.0000  HELLO...By reading the short Summary just below  you will see how you can learn new skills in communication  do a direct marketing program on the internet  and at the same time  earn $100 000 or more to enable you to CHANGE YOUR LIFE!!!  ************SUMMARY***************************  Just read this Summary  follow the actions that it advises  and start earning some serious money.  You will learn new skills in communications and how to market on the internet. What a Deal!  Your total cash investment is just $50.00.  Step 1.  If this is the first time you have seen this message  and you have not joined in this program before  then take out five US$10.00 bills (total $50 investment)  and mail out $10.00 each to the following people to purchase five Guides on communications.  For each Guide that you will be ordering and buying  write out on a sheet of plain white paper  your own name  address  and YOUR OWN EMAIL ADDRESS  and the number and name of the Guide that you are buying.  Then fold the paper  put the $10.00 bill inside the sheet of paper  insert the paper and $10.00 bill into an envelope  address the envelope with the name and address of the person whose name is shown under each Guide below  and mail the envelope by first class or air mail. Be sure to put enough postage stamps on the envelopes.  No need to send by registered mail.  LIST OF FIVE NAMES**************************** ________________________________________________  GUIDE# 1: ""How to be A More Effective Public Speaker"" Order Guide #1 for US$10.00 CASH from: (In addition to Guide #1  you will receive a valuable marketing Guide ""A Million Bucks From the Internet""  free of charge)  Derrick Nguyen	 9530 Whitmore St	 El Monte  CA 91733	 USA ________________________________________________  GUIDE # 2: ""How to Give a Business Presentation"" Order Guide # 2 for US$10.00 CASH from:  Tim Fai GPO Box 260 Macau (via Hong Kong) ________________________________________________  GUIDE# 3: ""How to Write More Effectively"" Order Guide # 3 for US$10.00 CASH from:  Luis Pastor Apartado 81 48080 Bilbao Spain ________________________________________________  GUIDE # 4: ""What to do at a Social Function"" Order Guide # 4 for US$10.00 CASH from:  Chester Waldvogel 11 Chestnut Way Berlin  MD 21811 USA ________________________________________________  GUIDE # 5: ""How To Sharpen Your Mind"" Order Guide # 5 for US$10.00 CASH from:  J. Siden Krondikesvagen 54 A 83147 Ostersund Sweden ________________________________________________ END OF LIST OF FIVE NAMES*********************  Step 2.  These Guides will be emailed to you.  Save these Guides on your computer's hard disk as other people will be ordering these Guides from you  paying you for them and you will need to email the Guides to the new buyers.  Step 3.  From the list of names above  delete the name and address of the person shown under GUIDE#5  and replace that slot with the name and address of the person from GUIDE #4's slot.  Be sure to copy the name and address exactly as shown. Check the address again.  Step 4.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #4  and replace with the name and address from GUIDE #3's slot.  Step 5.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #3  and replace with the name and address from  GUIDE#2's slot.  Step 6.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #2  and replace with the name and address from GUIDE #1's slot.  Step 7.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #1  and replace with YOUR OWN NAME AND ADDRESS. This step is how your own name and address is entered into the list of names to receive orders for the Guides. Eventually  your own name will go down the list of names until you have reached GUIDE #5  and then be dropped from the list. The key point is that the number of people ordering Guides from you will grow larger the lower down the list your name goes.  Step 8.  Once you have completed this new list  send out this new email (which shows your name under GUIDE #1) to as many email addresses as possible  as many as 100 000 emails or even more.  The greater the number of mailings you make  potentially the greater the number of people who will order the GUIDE #1 from you.  These people will then make new emails to send out to their addresses with the email showing your name under GUIDE #2  and so on.  This is all you need to do.  If you wish to read the rest of this email message  then do so.  If not  just do the 8 steps shown above. Remember  the key point is to send out as many emails as possible in step 8  and to encourage and help those who purchase the Guides from you to send out emails of their own.  Do NOT change anything other than what is instructed. Because if you do  it will not work for you.  Your immediate reaction might be: Why not replace all the names on the list with the names of your spouse  kids  relatives  and friends. That might seem to you like a clever move because new buyers will be sending their money to these people.  But that move is the exact opposite of what is to your benefit. What will benefit you most is having people who will send out emails  seek new buyers  and provide assistance to new buyers. If the people you slip into that list aren't going to be sending new emails  you're only hurting yourself by effectively closing down the program with your name on top of the list of the names that you have inserted.  There wouldn't be new buyers coming in. So  your sly maneuver will gain you exactly zero!  Furthermore  if you have done the work  and your name has worked its way to further down the list  by then you deserve the rewards and earnings from that effort  and it would be unethical for anyone to remove your name for whatever reason.  Don't do it to others. Remember  honesty reaps the reward!!!  You may have a concern that after sending the total $50 to the five people on the list that one of the people will just take your money  and not send you the Guide.  Well  rest assured.  As we said above  it's to our benefit to have you as a satisfied buyer who will actively send out emails to find new buyers.  So don't think the people on the list will try to cheat you or to ""stiff"" you for $10.00.  The people on the list would rather have you working hard because your effort will benefit them as well as you.  Later on  when other buyers send you the order to buy the Guides  fulfill your end of the deal by sending the ordered Guide to the buyer.  Don't cheat. Provide efficient and honest service and we will all benefit. ******END OF SUMMARY************************  =======REST OF MESSAGE======================  With easy-to-use email tools and opt-in email  success in this business is now well within the capabilities of ordinary people who may not have done any internet marketing before. And the earnings potential is staggering!  READ THIS EMAIL TO THE END! - follow what it says  - and you will not worry whether a RECESSION is coming or not  or whether or not you can afford to buy that new car or home that you have been looking for.  Yes  I know what you are thinking. I never responded to one of these before either. One day though  something made me feel: ""You use $50 going to a movie for 2 hours with your spouse  friend  or child  plus a simple meat at a restaurant.  Why the heck not?""  No matter where you believe those ""feelings"" came from  I thank every day that feeling came over me.  I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be doing had I not. Read on. It works.  And when you read the Guides  Youll learn how to become a more effective communicator. What can be better?  A way to improve your self-image and confidence and at the same time have the potential to recover your investment and make some good money: making over half a million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your home. If you work on this program  you will learn a lot about direct marketing on the internet.  If you believe direct marketing via the internet is the way sales and marketing will be done in the future  then the experience you will gain here could be a real boost in your work career  possibly even providing a new career for you.  = PRINT THIS MESSAGE FOR FUTURE REFERENCE =  If you want to make serious money  read this message until you understand it completely and feel confident to follow through on what it advises.  FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION ABOVE AND YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS CAN COME TRUE!  Remember  this method has been tested  and if you alter it  it will NOT work!  This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You are offering a product for sale to a buyer. Treat it as such and you can see money coming to you  in a reasonable period of time  depending on the collective efforts of yourself and the others on the list of five.  =========================================== *** Take this entire email  with the modified list of names  and save it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.  There are 2 methods to get this venture going:  METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK EMAIL LEGALLY ===========================================  Let's say that you start small  to see how it goes  and that you and those involved send out only 5 000 emails each. Let's also assume that the mailing receives only a 0.1% (1/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much better but let's just say it is only 0.1%). Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of emails instead of only 5 000 each.  Out of your 5 000 emails and a 0.1% response  that is only 5 orders for Guide # 1. Those 5 people who responded also send out 5 000 emails each for a total of 25 000. Out of those 25 000 emails only 0.1% responded with orders. That's 25 people who responded and ordered Guide # 2.  Those 25 people mail out 5 000 e-mails each for a total of 125 000 emails. The 0.1% response to that is 125 orders for Guide # 3. Those 125 people send 5 000 emails each for a total of 625 000 emails sent out. The 0.1% response is 625 orders for Guide # 4.  Those 625 people send out 5 000 emails each for a total of 3 125 000 emails. The 0.1% response to that is  3 125 orders for Guide # 5  or $31 250 at $10 per Guide.  This may seem a small amount to you  but remember we used a very low response rate with a small number of emails being sent out.  See what happens if you can get the response rate up just slightly.  If Response Rate is 0.1%  income from Guides #1 - #5 is: $50+250+1 250+6 250+31 250 = $39 050 (as above)  If Response Rate is 0.15%  income from Guides #1 - #5 is: $75+560+4 220+31 640+237 300 = $273 795  If Response Rate is 0.2%  income from Guides #1 - #5 is: $100+1 000+10 000+100 000+1 000 000 = $1 111 100  Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100 000 emails each or more?  From the example above  you can see the power of leveraging  that is  how much greater is the amount of money from a small increase in the response rate.  There are over 200 million people on the internet worldwide and counting  with thousands more coming online every day.  METHOD # 2: PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET ===========================================  Advertising on the net is very  very inexpensive and there are Many FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the internet will get a response. We strongly suggest you start with  Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $10 you receive  all you must do is email the Guide the buyer ordered. Always provide same day service.  The people you buy these Guides from will assist and advise you how to get the large number of email addresses that you need to send the new email containing your name and address.  In return  when others buy the Guides from you  you also should help those buyers to resell the Guides to their email addresses.  This will benefit you because your name would be further down the list  and their new buyers will buy from you.  This is no different than ""customer service"" in the retail or the  ""bricks and mortars"" business.  ===========AVAILABLE GUIDES ============== The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is illegal or somehow  ""wrong"". It is simply about time. Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved  etc. Concealing it is simply so no one can SEE there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you.  ORDER EACH GUIDE BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Always send a single $10 bill (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Guide.  Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is hidden by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of paper  write the NUMBER & the NAME of the Guide you are ordering  YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address.  Be sure to address the envelope correctly and put the proper amount of stamps to mail the envelope.  PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE GUIDES NOW FROM THE NAME AND ADDRESS LIST SHOWN AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS EMAIL ________________________________________________ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES  === If you do not receive at least 10 orders for GUIDE #1 within 2 weeks  continue sending emails until you do.  === Two to three weeks after you receive 10 orders  you should receive 100 orders or more for GUIDE #2. If not  continue advertising or sending emails until you do.  Once you have received 100 or more orders for GUIDE # 2  YOU CAN SEE THE PROGRAM IS WORKING  and cash should continue coming in! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER:  Continue to assist new buyers with advice and instruction on how to send out more emails.

You can make more money in the next few weeks and months than you have ever imagined. Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED.  Remember to email the revised copy of this email after you have put your name and address in GUIDE#1 and moved others to #2 .....# 5 slots as instructed above. One of the people you send this to may send out 100 000 or more emails and your name will be on every one of them. Remember  the more you send out the more potential buyers you will reach.  IT IS UP TO YOU!  ORDER THE GUIDES NOW AND EMBARK ON THE ROAD TO FINANCIAL SECURITY!

Research Alert - Undervalued August 26  2002 XrayMedia (OTCBB: XRMD) Alert Rating = 8  Congratulations to our subscribers who moved in fast on our last report!   Pick #1 - Internet incubator giant CMGI has paid off very well  up over 150% on major volume and great news.  Pick #2 - ENBC Began its' heavy move up over 200% hitting a high of over 300%...   Our Latest Discovery: XRMD - Several investment reporters featured XrayMedia during fiscal 2001/02. At the time  we felt that the advertising industry created a huge opportunity for the company's direct sourcing technology solutions  and so far the company has delivered. Although the company has raised just $2 million in the two years it has been developing its technology  it has increased revenues sources dramatically by opening a financial services division expanding the Live Media Marketplace expected revenues to $3-5 mm during fiscal 2003  driving the line in 2004 to $15- 25 mm. This remarkable growth becomes more understandable when one views the savings that its direct sourcing model generates for advertisers and retailers. The company saves advertising buyers up to 70% in costs dramatically increasing wholesale pricing effect  by saving time & efforts  cutting telephone and faxing bills  while providing free mass sourcing opportunities for negotiating advertising buying and selling opportunities using a secure state of the art real time negotiating technology over the Internet  weve never seen anything like it!  How does the company do this?   XrayMedia (OTCBB: XRMD) The Company founded XrayMedia in March 2000 to create a ""mass source to advertising sector "" live negotiating technology and advertising purchase financing accents the companys strengths  serving both large and small United States and International customers with advertising opportunities delivered directly from the media and the general public. *** With the use of proprietary software  it is providing sophistication to this industry which greatly expedites orders and finds opportunities based on the users criteria which results in a savings to the advertising buyers and as well as the ad sellers which it serves.   Their ""source to business model""  eliminates two levels of hindrance (sourcing and limited opportunities) and provides its customers with mass advertising choices and live negotiating that is designed give a substantially low cost base for finding the right advertising opportunity for all business with no cost.  While investors have thrown money recklessly at money-losing technology companies  here is a company that will increase revenues from $1 to $25 million in three years  and grow profitability substantially with little funding. XrayMedia is among the best performing sectors since September 11th  and we feel that XrayMedia is likely to break through its 52-week high of $00.19 soon.   *** Listed on the OTCBB and trading with an extremely low market valuation under 10 mm.  *** It has opened accounts with over hundreds of buyers and sellers including some of the largest media buyers in the world  major retailers and smaller retailers.   *** Attracting interest of major investment bankers and analysts  also a possible acquisition target at some point by major retailers.  *** Received largest order of advertising financing over $500k with more contracts accumulating.  *** Revenue growth is expected to be dramatic $1mm to $5mm.   *** The company is expected to report a profitable quarter  to grow revenues and earnings ""substantially"" when it begins its 2003 fiscal year in January.

After due deliberation with my colleagues  We have decided to forward to you this business proposal. We want a reliable  person who could assist us in the transfer the sum of Twenty Million  Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars (  $20 500 000 ). Via International Bank Draft Cashable in any First World Countries.  This fund resulted from an over-invoiced bill from contracts awarded by us under the budget allocation to our Ministry. This  bill has been approved for payment by the other concerned Ministries. The contract has since been executed   commissioned and the contractor was paid the actual cost of the contract. We are left with the balance US$20.5M as part  of the over-invoiced amount which we have deliberated over estimated for our own use. But under our protocol division  we  as civil servants are forbidden to operate or own foreign accounts. This is why we are soliciting your assistance in this  manner and regard .  As you may want to know and to make you less curious  I got your address from adverts in the business directory . I am the  Chief Accountant/Internal Auditor of the Contract Award Committee ( CAC ) of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation  ( NNPC). This transaction is very much free from all sorts of RISKS and TROUBLE from my Government. We the N.N.P.C.  Officials involved in this deal have put in many years in service to this Ministry. We have been exercising patience for this  opportunity for so long and to most of us this is a life time opportunity we cannot afford to miss.  We have agreed to COMPENSATE you duly if agreement is reached by both of us and I and one of my colleagues  involved in this deal will come to your country to arrange for our share  upon the confirmation from you that the Certified  International Bank Draft has been Approved and Raised in your favor.  Consequent upon your acceptance of this proposal  kindly confirm your interest by Telephone to me  through my Direct Tel  No: +873-762-692484. (Please Call Direct  DO NOT add my country(234) and City(1) codes ) . Your indication by revert  Telephone to me of your sincere and serious interest will enable me fax you or brief you of  the PROCEDURES FOR THIS  TRANSACTION. If my line is busy  please keep trying you will surely get through. NOTE: In the event of your inability to handle this transaction please inform us so that we can look for another reliable  person who can assist in this respect.   It might surprise you why we choose you and trusted you for this transaction. Yes  we believe that good friends can be  discovered and business like this can not be realized without mutual trust. This is why we have decided to trust you for this  transaction. Be further informed that everyones interest and security had been considered before you were contacted  so be rest assured and feel free to go into this transaction with  us.

X-Priority: 1 X-Mailer: Microsoft Outlook Express 5.00.2919.6900 DM MIME-Version: 1.0 Content-Type: text/plain; charset=""us-ascii"" X-MIME-Autoconverted: from quoted-printable to 8bit by webnote.net id PAA10752 Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit  I am Mr.IKE EJOH. Bank Manager of Diamond Bank of Nigeria  Lagos Branch. I have urgent and very confidential business proposal for you. On June 6  1999 a FOREIGN Oil consultant/contractor with the FEDERAL MINISTRY OF AVIATIONMr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months  valued at US$25 000 000.00 (Twenty- five Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity  I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month  we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his  employers  the FEDERAL MINISTRY OF AVIATION that Mr. Barry Kelly died from an automobile accident. On further investigation  I found out that he died without making a WILL  and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents  including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.This sum of US$25 000 000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one willever come forward to claim it.According to Nigerian Law  at the expiration of 6 (six) years  the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently  i have just sucided in getting this fund sent to holland through a security company called GLOBAL& BASIC FINANCIAL COMPANY.  I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that i will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits  which will put you in place as the owner of this fund in the security company. i shall employ the service of an Attorney for drafting and notarization of the changes  and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate & administration in your favour. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Bran ch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested  please replyimmediately via the private email address . Upon your response  I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality  and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.  Awaiting your urgent reply via my email:   Thanks and regards.   MR.IKE EJOH",1

Of course it does. You most likely have just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program (USA). And reported elsewhere in the world (including my neck of the woods - New Zealand). His mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-old sons closet. Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash. Five-dollar bills  twenties  fifties and hundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in labelled piles.  ""My first thought was that he had robbed a bank""  says the 41-year-old woman  ""There was over $71 000 dollars in that bag --that's more than my husband earns in a year"".  The woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership where he worked to tell him what she had discovered.He came home right away and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up.  Little did they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet.  As it turns out  the boy had been sending out  via E-mail  a type of  ""Report"" to E-mail addresses that he obtained off the Internet. Everyday after school for the past 2 months  he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom.  ""I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the heck  I put my name on it like the instructions said and I started sending it out""  says the clever 15-year-old.  The E-mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained instructions to send one $5 dollar bill to each person on the list  then delete the address at the top and move the others addresses Down   and finally to add your name to the top of the list.  The letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand dollars in five-dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the 5-address list. ""I get junk E-mail all the time  and really did not think it was going to work""  the boy continues.  Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail  the Post Office Box that his parents had gotten him for his video-game magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines  but envelopes containing $5 bills.  ""About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post office and my box had 1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it. There was also a yellow slip that said I had to go up to the [post office] counter. I thought I was in trouble or something (laughs)"". He goes on  ""I went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me. I had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because I could not carry it all"".  Over the next few weeks  the boy continued sending out the E-mail.""  The money just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet  barely had time for my homework"".He had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $5 bills for twenties   fifties and hundreds.  ""I didn't want the banks to get suspicious so I kept riding to different banks with like five thousand at a time in my backpack. I would usually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the money] and he was outside waiting for me.One time the lady gave me a really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me and my dad would have to come in and do it  but I just rode to the next bank down the street (laughs).""  Surprisingly  the boy did not have any reason to be afraid.The reporting news   team examined and investigated the so-called ""chain-letter"" the boy was sending out and found that it was not a chain-letter at all.In fact  it was completely legal according to US Postal and Lottery Laws  Title 18  Section 1302 and 1341  or Title 18  Section 3005 in the US code  also in the code of federal regulations  Volume 16  Sections 255 and 436  which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received.  Every five-dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read  ""Please send me report number XYX"".This simple note made the letter legal because he was exchanging a service (A Report on how-to) for a  five-dollar fee.  [This is the end of the media release. If you would like to understand how the system works and get your $71 000 - please continue reading. What  appears below is what the 15 year old was sending out on the net -  YOU CAN USE IT TOO - just follow the simple instructions].  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ BE FINANCIALLY FREE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!! Before you say ""Bull""  please read the following. This is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the  Internet  a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below  to see if it really can make people money. The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal. Their findings proved once and for all that there are ""absolutely NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can follow the simple instructions  they are bound to make some megabucks with only $25 out of pocket cost"".   DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED  IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER.   Note* follow the directons below  I had best results the second time when I hired a bulk email service in addition to following the reports instructions.  In order for all of us to be successful  many  many emails must be sent so that the returns are many. I have been extremely successful using the following company. They send out the offers  and all I do is accept money for reports  then I send back to the people as soon as possible.  This is what one had to say: ""Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I was  approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment  I received total $610 470.00 in 21 weeks  with money still coming in"".  Pam Hedland  Fort Lee  New Jersey.  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Here is another testimonial: ""This program has been around for a long time  but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again in the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to come in. First month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made a total of $290 000.00. So far  in the past 8 months by re-entering the program  I have made over $710 000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change anything."" More testimonials later but first   PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE  ++++ Order all 5 reports shown on the list below +++ For each report  send $5 CASH  THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE  REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT  CORNER in case of any mail problems.   When you place your order  make sure you order each of the 5 reports. You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer. Within a few days you will receive  vie e-mail  each of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1 000's of people who will order them from you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case something happens to your computer.   IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report  or their sequence on the list  in any way other than what is instructed below in step ""1 through 6"" or you will loose out on majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this works  you will also see how it does not work if you change it. Remember  this method has been tested  and if you alter  it will NOT work!!! People have tried to put their friends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money. But it does not work this way. Believe us  we all have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not try to change anything other than what is instructed. Because if you do  it will not work for you. Remember  honesty reaps the reward!!!   1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports  take this advertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # 5. This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune. 2.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT #5. 3.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT #4. 4.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT #3. 5.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT #2 6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.   PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY! +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++   **** Take this entire letter  with the modified list of names  and save it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES. Save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data. To assist you with marketing your business on the internet  the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally  where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more. There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going:   METHOD #1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++   Let's say that you decide to start small  just to see how it goes  and we will assume You and those involved send out only 5 000e-mails each. Let's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5 000 each). Continuing with this example  you send out only 5 000 e-mails.   With a 0.2% response  that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded by sending out 5 000 e-mail each for a total of 50 000. Out of those 50 000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That equals 100 people responded and ordered Report # 2.  Those 100 people mail out 5 000 e-mails each for a total of 500 000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report #3.  Those 1000 people send out 5 000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10 000 orders for Report #4.  Those 10 000 people send out 5 000 e-mails each for a total of 50 000 000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100 000 orders for Report #5. THAT'S 100 000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=$500 000.00 (half million). Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 +2.....$500 + 3.....$5 000 + 4..... $50 000 + 5..... $500 000....... Grand Total=$555 550.00   NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT  YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY!  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ REMEMBER FRIEND  THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5 000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100 000e-mails each or more? There are over 150 million people on  the Internet worldwide and counting. Believe me  many people will do just that  and more!   METHOD #2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will easily get a larger response.   We strongly suggest you start with Method #1 and add METHOD #2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive  all you must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day service on all orders. This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out with your name and address on it  will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report.  =ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper or aluminum foil. On one of those sheets of paper  Write the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you are ordering  YOUR E-MAIL  ADDRESS and your name and postal address.   PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW: +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ REPORT #1: The Insider's Guide to Advertising for Free on the Net  Order Report #1 from: R. R.

If you did not  continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do.  +++ Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report #2  YOU CAN RELAX  because the system is already working for you  and the cash will continue to roll in! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your name is moved down on the list  you are placed in front of a Different report. You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate from this business!!!  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: You have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life  with NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can make more money in the next few weeks and months than you have ever imagined. Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way. It works exceedingly well as it is now.  Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your name and address in Report#1 and moved others to #2 thru #5 as instructed above. One of the people you send this to may send out 100 000 or more e-mails and your name will be on every one of them. Remember though  the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach. So my friend  I have given you the ideas  information   materials and opportunity to become financially independent.  IT IS UP TO YOU NOW!  ++++++++++++++++ MORE TESTIMONIALS ++++++++++++++++ ""My name is Mitchell. My wife  Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving  ""junk mail"". I made fun of the whole thing  spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved. I ""knew"" it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of her  and was ready to lay the old  ""I told you so"" on her when the thing didn't work. Well  the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she had received total $ 147 200.00....all cash! I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her ""hobby"".  Mitchell Wolf  Chicago  Illinois  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ ""Not being the gambling type  it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am  I decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back"". ""I was surprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with orders. I made $319 210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return and so big"".  Dan Sondstrom  Alberta  Canada  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ ""I had received this program before. I deleted it  but later I wondered if I should have given it a try. Of course  I had no idea who to contact to get another copy  so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone else......11 months passed then it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one! I made more than $490 000 on my first try and all the money came within 22 weeks"".

You are receiving this letter because you have expressed an interest in receiving information about online business opportunities. If this is erroneous then please accept my most sincere apology. This is a one-time mailing  so no removal is necessary.   If you've been burned  betrayed  and back-stabbed by multi-level marketing  MLM  then please read this letter. It could be the most important one that has ever landed in your Inbox.   MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING IS A HUGE MISTAKE FOR MOST PEOPLE   MLM has failed to deliver on its promises for the past 50 years. The pursuit of the ""MLM Dream"" has cost hundreds of thousands of people their friends  their fortunes and their sacred honor.  The fact is that MLM is fatally flawed  meaning that it CANNOT work for most people.  The companies and the few who earn the big money in MLM are NOT going to tell you the real story. FINALLY  there is someone who has the courage to cut through the hype and lies and tell the TRUTH about MLM.   HERE'S GOOD NEWS   There IS an alternative to MLM that WORKS  and works BIG! If you haven't yet abandoned your dreams  then you need to see this. Earning the kind of income you've dreamed about is easier than you think!   With your permission  I'd like to send you a brief letter that will tell you WHY MLM doesn't work for most people and will then introduce you to something so new and refreshing that you'll wonder why you haven't heard of this before.   I promise that there will be NO unwanted follow up  NO sales pitch  no one will call you  and your email address will only be used to send you the information. Period.   To receive this free  life-changing information  simply click Reply  type ""Send Info"" in the Subject box and hit Send. I'll get the information to you within 24 hours. Just look for the words MLM WALL OF SHAME in your Inbox.   Cordially    Mark R Sherman   P.S. Someone recently sent the letter to me and it has been the most eye-opening  financially beneficial information I have ever received. I honestly believe that you will feel the same way once you've read it.

As Seen on TV! 65000$+ X-Reply-To: MakeMoney@legally.com Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1 Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit  THE ULTIMATE WAY TO WORK FROM HOME  THE BEST MONEY MAKING SYSTEM OF ALL!!  AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV  As seen on 20/20 and many other credible references. This is NOT a scam.  I hope this is ok that I send you this. If you aren't interested  just  simply delete it.  READ THIS MESSAGE if you are like me and want more than your lousy  weekly paycheck. Make more in a few months than last year at work.  Believe it  work it.  This really works  don't make the same mistake I made. I deleted this  4-5 times before finally giving it a try. Within 2 weeks the orders  (money)  started coming in just like the plan below said it would. Give it a  try!!  You will be glad you did.  Thanks and Good Luck! You won't need luck  just keep reading. Don't  delete this!!!  ------------------------------------------------------  First read about how a 15 year old made $71 000. See below....  AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV: This is the media report.  PARENTS OF 15 - YEAR OLD - FIND $71 000 CASH HIDDEN  IN HIS CLOSET!  Does this headline look familiar? Of course it does.  You most likely have just seen this story recently  featured on a major nightly news program (USA).  And reported elsewhere in the world (including my neck  of the woods - New Zealand). His mother was cleaning  and putting laundry away when she came across a large  brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath  some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her  15-year-old sons closet.  Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got  when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash.  Five-dollar bills  twenties  fifties and hundreds -  all neatly rubber-banded in labeled piles.  ""My first thought was that he had robbed a bank""   says the 41-year-old woman  ""There was over $71 000  dollars in that bag -- that's more than my husband  earns in a year"".  The woman immediately called her husband at the  car-dealership where he worked to tell him what she  had discovered. He came home right away and they  drove together to the boys school and picked him up.  Little did they suspect that where the money came from  was more shocking than actually finding it in  the closet.  As it turns out  the boy had been sending out  via  E-mail  a type of ""Report"" to E-mail addresses that he  obtained off the Internet. Everyday after school for  the past 2 months  he had been doing this right on his  computer in his bedroom.  ""I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the  heck  I put my name on it like the instructions said  and I started sending it out""  says the clever  15-year-old.  The E-mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained  instructions to send one $5 dollar bill to each person  on the list  then delete the address at the top and  move the others addresses down  and finally to add  your name to the top of the list.  The letter goes on to state that you would receive  several thousand dollars in five-dollar bills within 2  weeks if you sent out the letter with your  name at the top of the 5-address list. ""I get junk  E-mail all the time  and really did not think it was  going to work""  the boy continues.  Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail   the Post Office Box that his parents had gotten him  for his video-game magazine subscriptions began to  fill up with not magazines  but envelopes containing  $5 bills.  ""About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post  office and my box had 1 magazine and about 300  envelops stuffed in it. There was also a yellow slip  that said I had to go up to the [post office] counter.  I thought I was in trouble or something (laughs)"". He  goes on  ""I went up to the counter and they had a  whole box of more mail for me. I had to ride back  home and empty out my backpack because I could not  carry it all"".  Over the next few weeks  the boy continued sending  out the E-mail. ""The money just kept coming in and I  just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet   barely had time for my homework"". He had also  been riding his bike to several of the banks in his  area and exchanging the $5 bills for twenties  fifties  and hundreds.  ""I didn't want the banks to get suspicious so I kept  riding to different banks with like five thousand at a  time in my backpack. I would usually tell the lady at  the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to  exchange the money and he was outside waiting for me.  One time the lady gave me a really strange look and  told me that she would not be able to do it for me and  my dad would have to come in and do it  but I just  rode to the next bank down the street (laughs).""  Surprisingly  the boy did not have any reason to be  afraid. The reporting news team examined and  investigated the so-called ""chain-letter"" the boy was  sending out and found that it was not a chain-letter  at all. In fact  it was completely legal according to  US Postal and Lottery Laws  Title 18  Section 1302 and  1341  or Title 18  Section 3005 in the US code  also  in the code of federal regulations  Volume 16   Sections 255 and 436  which state a product or service  must be exchanged for money received.  Every five-dollar bill that he received contained a  little note that read  ""Please send me report number  XYX"".This simple note made the letter legal because he  was exchanging a service (A Report on how-to) for a  five-dollar fee.  [This is the end of the media release. If you would  like to understand how the system works and get your  $71 000 - please continue reading. What appears below  is what the 15 year old was sending out on the net -  YOU CAN USE IT TOO - just follow the simple  instructions].  THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET !  ==================================================  You will Make over half million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your  home!!  Before you say ''Bull''  please read the following. This is the  letter you have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the  popularity of this letter on the Internet  a national weekly news  program  recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program  described below  to see if it really can make people money. The show  also  investigated whether or not the program was legal.  Their findings proved once and for all that there are ''absolutely NO  Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can -follow  the simple instructions  they are bound to make some mega bucks with only  $25 out of pocket cost''.  DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS  PROGRAM HAS  ATTAINED  IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER.  This is what one had to say: '' Thanks to this profitable opportunity.  I was approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so  glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for  the minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment  I received  total  $610 470.00 in 21 weeks  with money still coming in''.  Pam Hedland  Fort Lee  New Jersey.  ========================================================= =======Here is  another testimonial: ''' this program has been around for a  long time but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this  again in the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the  simple instructions and wallaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to  come  in. First month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that  made a total of $290 000.00. So far  in the past 8 months by re-entering  the  program  I have made over $710 000.00 and I am playing it again. The  key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change  anything.'' More testimonials later but first:  ===== PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE ========  $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ $$$$$$$$  If you would like to make at least $500 000 every 4 to 5 months easily  and comfortably  please read the following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and  AGAIN!!!  $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ $$$$$$$$  FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND YOUR FINANCIAL  DREAMS WILL COME  TRUE  GUARANTEED!  INSTRUCTIONS:  ================Order all 5 reports shown on the list below  =================  For each report  send $5 CASH  THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT  YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose  name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN  ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail  problems.  === When you place your order  make sure you order each of the 5  reports.  You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer  and resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5=$25.00.  Within a few days you will receive  via e-mail  each of the 5 reports  from these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will  be accessible for you to send to the 1 000's of people who will order them  from you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk  in case something happens to your computer.  IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed  next to each report  or their sequence on the list  in any way other  than what is instructed below in step '' 1 through 6 '' or you will  loose out on majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this  works  you will also see how it does not work if you change it. Remember   this  method has been tested  and if you alter  it will NOT work !!! People  have tried to put their friends/relatives names on all five thinking they  could get all the money. But it does not work this way.

Remember  honesty reaps the reward!!!  1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports  take this advertisement  and REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT #5.  This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting  their fortune.  2.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.  3.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.  4.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.  5.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2  6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.  PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY!  ========================================================= =======  **** Take this entire letter  with the modified list of names  and save it  on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.  Save this on a disk as well just in case you loose any data. To assist  you with marketing your business on the internet  the 5 reports you  purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which  includes how to send bulk e-mails legally  where to find thousands of  free  classified ads and much more. There are 2 Primary methods to get this  venture going:  METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY  ========================================================= =======  Let's say that you decide to start small  just to see how it goes  and  we will assume You and those involved send out only 5 000 e-mails each.  Let's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the  response  could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many  people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5 000  each).Continuing with this example  you send out only 5 000 e-mails.  With a 0.2% response  that is only 10 orders for report # 1  Those 10 people responded by sending out 5 000 e-mail each for a total  of 50 000.  Out of those 50 000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's=100  people responded and ordered Report # 2.  Those 100 people mail out 5 000 e-mails each for a total of 500 000  e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.  Those 1000 people send out 5 000 e-mails each for a total of 5  million e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10 000 orders  for Report! # 4. Whose 10 000 people send out 5 000 e-mails each for a  total of  50 000 000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100 000  orders for  Report # 5 THAT'S 100 000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=$500 000.00 (half  million).  Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500  + 3.....$5 000 + 4..... $50 000 + 5..... $500 000 ........ Grand  Total=$555 550.00  NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE  WORST POSSIBLERESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU  CALCULATE IT  YOU WILL STILL  MAKE A LOT OF MONEY !  ========================================================= =======  REMEMBER FRIEND  THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING  OUT  OF 5 000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if  everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100 000e-mails  each or more? There are over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide  and counting. Believe me  many people will do just that  and more!  METHOD # 2 : BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET  ========================================================= =======  Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are  hundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the  Internet will easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you  start with Method # 1and add METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you  receive  all you must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's  it. Always provide  same day service on all orders.  This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out  with your  name and address on it  will be prompt because they can not advertise  until they receive the report.  ===================AVAILABLE REPORTS  ==========================  ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always  send  $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure  the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On  one of those sheets of paper  Write the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you  are ordering   YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address.  PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW :  ========================================================= =======  REPORT #1 ""The Insider's Guide to Advertising for Free on the Net""  Order Report #1 from:  K.Palludan  9550 Summersweet Ct.

Lasley  4230 Edgewood Circle  Idaho Falls  Idaho 83406  USA  ________________________________________________________________ _____  $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES  $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$  Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:  === If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 2  weeks  continue sending e-mails until you do.  === After you have received 10 orders  2 to 3 weeks after that you  should receive 100 orders or more for REPORT # 2. If you did not  continue  advertising or sending e-mails until you do.  === Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report # 2  YOU CAN  RELAX  because the system is already working for you  and the cash will  continue to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your  name  is moved down on the list  you are placed in front of a Different report.  You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report  people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME  SEND  ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS  AGAIN. There is NO  LIMIT to the income you can generate from this business !!!  ========================================================= =======  FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM:  You have just received information that can give you financial freedom  for the rest of your life  with NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT.

So  my friend  I have given you the ideas  information  materials and  opportunity to become financially independent. IT IS UP TO YOU NOW !  ====================== MORE  TESTIMONIALS======================  '' My name is Mitchell. My wife  Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an  accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good  money. When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving  ''junk mail''. I made fun of the whole thing  spouting my knowledge of  the population and percentages involved. I ''knew'' it wouldn't work. Jody  totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in  with  both feet. I made merciless fun of her  and was ready to lay the old  ''I told you so'' on her when the thing didn't work. Well  the laugh was  on me!  Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she  had  received total $ 147 200.00 ........... all cash! I was shocked. ! I have  joined  Jody in her ''hobby''.  Mitchell Wolf M.D.  Chicago  Illinois  ========================================================= ======= '' Not  being the gambling type  it took me several weeks to make up my  mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am  I decided  that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that  I  wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back''. '' I was  surprised  when I found my medium size post office box crammed with orders. I made  $319 210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is  that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't a better  investment  with a faster return and so big''.  Dan Sondstrom  Alberta  Canada  ========================================================= ======= '' I had  received this program before. I deleted it  but later I  wondered if I should have given it a try. Of course  I had no idea who  to contact ! to get another copy  so I had to wait until I was e-mailed  again by someone else.........11 months passed then it luckily came  again.....I did not delete this one! I made more than $490 000 on my  first try and all the money came within 22 weeks''.  Susan De Suza  New York  N.Y.  ========================================================= ======  '' It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with  little cost to you. I followed the simple instructions carefully and  within 10 days the money started to come in. My first month I made  $20 560.00 and by the end of third month my total cash count was $  362 840.00.

I was  until recently  a final  year engineering student of the University of Sierra Leone West Africa.  Early in January last year  the rebels in my country struck our township and killed my parents in one of their attacks. My late father  King Christopher George being the King of the Town was a prime target.  Fortunately for me  I was in school when the attack took  place. I equally lost my only sister to the rebels. When I got home for the remains of my parents and the subsequent burial that followed  I discovered a document indicating that my late father had deposited some $6M.United States Dollars(six million united states dollars) with one of the private security company here in abidjan cote d'ivorie. This money  according to the docement  was meant for the building of an Auto repair company for me by my late father when I complete my studies. Upon the discovery of this document  I travelled to the cote d'ivorie to trace the concerned security company and to make claims for the said money as the only surviving next of kin to my father.  But deliberatley  I have decided to keep all my uncles and Aunts out of the issue as none of them will be happy to know I am in possession of such money. I have succeded in making the people at the security company believe that I am the next of Kin and all the documents related to are now with me. I do not know what to do with it but I have decided to contact you to seek your assistance in helping me to take it outfrom the security company and transfer it  to your account and help me to come to your country to continue my education and so that you will help me to get the money invested until such a time that I will be ready to begin to use it. I am really desperate as I am left alone now in the world.Let me know what you want as compensation for helping me to solve this my problem. Most importantly Iseriously appeal that you maintain high level of secrecy and confidentiality in the whole thing.

I am sorry this mail Will surprise you  though we do not know   Due to the current war against white farmers in Zimbabwe and the support of President Robert Mugabe to Claim all white owned farms in our country to gain Favor for re-election.  All white farmers were asked to Surrender their farms to the government for Re-distribution and infact to his political party Members and my father though black was the treasury of the farmers association and a strong member of an Opposition party that did not support the president Idea. He then ordered his party members and the police Under his pay row to invade my father's farm and burn Down everything in the farm. They killed my Father and took away a lot of items from his farm. After the death of my father  our local pastor and a Close friend of my father handed us over will Documents with instructions from my father that we Should leave Zimbabwe incase anything happen to him. The will  Documents has a certificate of deposit  confirming a deposit Kept in custody for us in a security company unknown To the company that the content is money hence it was deposited as  Personal belongings and ensure that we do not remain here as we could Easily be found by his enemies. The total amount is US$21.5M.We are therefore soliciting for Your assistance to help us move the fund out of Zimbabwe  as our fate and future is far from reality  hence this mail to you. The president's present ban of International Press into Zimbabwe and the drop from office of the  Finance Minister to avoid giving white farmers fund Transfer Clearance above US$1M is just a few of the Unthinkable things he is committing in my Country. I have tried to reach my father's close friend Mr. John Casahans from Australia also a farmer who was Leaving in Zimbabwe with us but left with his family Late last year following this ugly development to no Avail. Should you be interested to help us  contact me Immediately via email for easy communication and I Will furnish you with the time frame and modalities of the transaction. We have concluded a wonderful plan of  Caring out the transfer within two weeks. Please note that  This transaction is100% confidential and risk free and will  Not endanger you or us in any way. We have resolved to give you 20% Of the total sum upon confirmation of the fund in any Account of your choice were the incident of taxation will not take much tool on the money and we look Forward to coming over to your country to invest our Share and settle there. I will a private Phone so that our conversation can be 100% confidential.  NOTE: DO REPLY TO bulmulete@golfemail.com   God bless you indeed as you help yourself and us.

Theo Duba of Zimbabwe. I got your address from South African Information exchange Johannesburg. .  Due to the previous war against white farmers in Zimbabwe by PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE and his supporters to claim all the white owned farms in our country  he ordered all the White owned farmers to surrender all their farms to his party members and his followers. My father was a victim of this oppression and inhuman behavior as he was one of the richest farmers in our country my fayher was totaly against the act by the presidnt MUGABE. The presidents supporters invaded my fathers farm  burnt everything in the farm  arrested him and confiscated all his investment.  Early last year when this victimization of white farmers by president Mugabe started  my late father envisaged a worse situation  he arranged almost all his money concealed it in a box and smuggled it out of Zimbabwe through Diplomatic means to South Africa. When he arrived South Africa  he lodged the box in a private security company through the help of his lawyer here in South Africa without revealing the real contents of the box to the security company  then  went back home. He registered the box as family treasure.  While he was still in detention that led to his death due to torture  he directed me to his lawyer in South Africa because of the escalation of the crisis in Zimbabwe. He did not want my life to be in danger. He was arrested on the 5th of March last year. Unfortunately my dear father died on the 10th of December 2001.I came to south Africa March 2002.  Now my stay here in Africa is frustrating and depressing because my fathers lawyer is presently hospitalized in London due to terrible heart problem; though the lodgment documents are with me  as such I want to relocate to your country for good. Presently  my residence permit here in South Africa is an Asylum permit as a refugee.  I am seeking for your assistance in transferring the money in the security company (US$15 Million) out of this country to your country for investment. If you think you can help me  Please try to get in touch with me immediately with the  number below . Your compensation/share for assistance will be negotiated if you are ready to assist me. Since the problem in my country is still lingering  please endeavor to keep this information to yourself and secret  because I wouldnt want anything that will expose me  and the existence of this money.  Your urgent response will be highly appreciated.  Sincerely yours   STEVEN DUBA (DR).  TEL:27-83-713-2696           __________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!? Yahoo!

I am moved to write you this letter.   This was in confidence considering my present circumstance and situation. I escaped along with my husband and two of our sons James Kongolo and Nzanga out of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to Abidjan  Coted'ivoire where my family and I settled  while we later moved to settled in Morroco where my husband later died of cancer disease. However  due to this situation we decided to change most of my husband's billions of dollars deposited in Swiss bank and other countries into other forms of money coded for safe purpose because the new head of state of (Dr) Mr Laurent Kabila has made arrangement with the Swiss government and other European countries to freeze all my late husband's treasures deposited in some european countries.   Hence  my children and I decided laying low in Africa to study the situation till when things gets better. Like now that president Kabila is dead and the son taking over (Joseph Kabila). One of my late husband's chateaux in Southern France was confiscated by the french government  and as such I had to change my identity so that my investment will not be traced and confiscated.I have deposited the sum Eighteen Million United State Dollars (US$18 000 000 00.) With a security company for safe keeping. What I want you to do is to indicate yourinterest that you can assist us in receiving the money on our behalf  so that I can introduce you to my son (Kongolo) who has the out modalities for the claim of the said funds. I want you to assist in investing this money  but I will not want my identity revealed.I will also want to acquire real/landed properties and stock in multi-national companies and to engage in other safe and non-speculative investments as adviseby your good self. May I at this point emphasize the high level of confidentiality  which this upcoming project demands and hope you will not betray the trust and confidence  which I repose in you.In conclusion  if you want to assist us  my son (Kongolo) shall divulgeto you all briefs regarding this project  tell you where the funds are currently being maintained and also discuss remuneration for your services.For this reason kindly furnish us your contact information that is your personal telephone and fax number for validation purpose and acknowledge receipt of this mail using the above email address.

FT.) installed  meeting All codes and spray applied. Many companies we talk to have a product that appears to be perfect BUT they haven't spent the money to test over foam. Maybe a small committee could do a evaluation of various products  report results to SPFA  who in turn will ""acquire funding"" from US. &nbsp; #136-2 William B  Australia we are in Australia but we are finding it hard to locate polyurea sprayers here so that we can start a chapter of the pda do u have any list of Australian contractors /suppliers ????or maybe they can put their hand up and lets us know at enviroline@powerup.com.au &nbsp;it is&nbsp;for the better&nbsp;of the game that an association is need to inform clients and specifiers of the uses and properties of polyureas and train its own members also to keep cowboys out that give the industry a bad name  &nbsp; #136-3 Ed M. I am a writer for aviation magazines and one that I write for is a Test International  a new publication that just launched this month. I need any new processes you might have that would be used on aircraft  particularly commercial aviation.&nbsp; #136-4 John C  Louisiana I have a Foam Cat 2000 Graco machine and a Probler gun with a 01 tip.&nbsp; I use this setup to spray truck bed liners.&nbsp; My question is can I and how do I spray foam insulation using my equipment?&nbsp; And what are the different types of insulation? &nbsp; #136-5 Murph Mahaffey  Glas-Craft I like the new look of the Industry Forum! &nbsp; #136-6 Mark W  South Carolina I'm sick of all this garbage about covering foam with a ""thermal Barrier"". What the hell do you think foam is? If you are saying that anything that can be FORCED to burn should be covered with a FIREPROOF barrier  then you'd better get busy covering all those trusses and joists and plywood up there that are definitely NOT carrying a class one fire rating. This double standard for foam is coming directly from those who stand to lose business from it. Icynene is DIFFERENT.&nbsp; IT DOESN'T BURN ALONE. IT DOESN'T MELT. IT DOESN'T EMIT PHOSGENE. Does it smoke in a fire situation? Sure  so what? Blaming foam in the attic for a house fire because it forces the foam to eventually burn is about as stupid as blaming foam seat cushions for burning when a gas tank ruptures and burns up a car. Get real  inspectors. You want us to cover up the only thing in the attic assembly that DOESN'T BURN!&nbsp; As for the vaunted R rating system  IT IS TOTALLY BOGUS. The test is designed to make porous insulations APPEAR to perform better than they actually do.&nbsp; Measuring only conduction and ignoring convection and radiant to convective transfer  the test should have been thrown out for the industry lackey it is 20 years ago  along with that obsolete fiberglassgarbage they're still selling everybody.&nbsp; There's a reason they don't make refrigerators  freezers coolers &amp; coffee cups out of fiberglass or cellulose.&nbsp;&nbsp; Think about it. &nbsp; #136-7 Dirk Benthien  Forum Moderator Thank you  Mark and Dik  for your statements above. I also feel that far too often individuals and companies are too complacent and quietly live with rules and regulations without trying to change them&nbsp; -&nbsp; even if everybody knows they do not make sense. We are all experts and representatives of this industry and should speak up and promote change! &nbsp; #136-8 Martin S  Canada Does anyone make a dispensing machine for crumb rubber / urethane blends ?  &nbsp; #136-9 Carole L  California re #135-8 Otto V  Germany What are the answers? (Phase-out of 141b) &nbsp; #136-10 Brian D  Canada &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There has been a lot of talk about ceramic coatings.&nbsp; We are a distributor of such a coating.&nbsp; We have never professed an R-20.&nbsp; Reason = is there isn't an ASTM test available to measure coatings for R-value. We compare standardized insulation to Ceramic coatings via BTU loss calculations.&nbsp; Depending on the criteria we can equal 2 to 3 inches of standard insulation with an aluminum jacket.&nbsp; We have the data and the projects to prove it.&nbsp;  #136-11 CPI We have inquiries from a number of people for used equipment - especially Gusmer H20/35  H2000  H2  GX-7 and Glas-Craft Probler.

June 4  1999- Sirs: The following text was located on a site written or placed by you or under your control:  ""DOM is located on Karitane Island and now includes the Taongi Atoll in the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the South Pacific 1000 miles south of Tahiti. However  the Marshall Islands government has condemned the ""fraudulent assertions"" of two organizations  namely the DOM and sister nation  the Kingdom of EnenKio (the Marshallese name for Wake Island)  claiming to represent the mid-Pacific nation amid an alleged investment scam according to an article in Agence France- Presse. The Marshall Islands foreign ministry has issued warnings to countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of either nation.""  ""A Honolulu-based attorney created the ""Kingdom of EnenKio"" in the early 1990s. It was based on a power of attorney agreement with Marshall Islands paramount chief Mursel Hermios  which granted the attorney broad powers to act on his behalf. The Marshall Islands High Court has ruled the agreement invalid and ordered it nullified  which the ""kingdom"" has disputed."" http://www.goldhaven.com/issue4/Two.htm (disconnected as of 2/1/00)  The purpose of this letter is lodge a formal request for correction of false and misleading statements made by the author regarding the Kingdom of EnenKio. While I am pleased to find you have apparently taken a serious interest in the Kingdom of EnenKio  I am aghast at how distorted  erroneous and misleading the article is. As a consequence of my service to His Majesty King Remios and the people of EnenKio  I am obligated to respond to incidents such as this. I will respectfully offer the following line by line correction. For your convenience  your text will be set off (with ""**"") in color: **DOM is located on Karitane Island and now includes the Taongi Atoll in the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the South Pacific 1000 miles south of Tahiti.** (Comment: The construction of this statement implies the Marshall Islands are in the South Pacific Ocean 1000 miles south of Tahiti  in which case a reader may be misled.)  Correction: DOM is located on Karitane Island in the South Pacific  1000  miles south of Tahiti  and now includes Taongi Atoll in the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the North Pacific. **However  the Marshall Islands government has condemned the ""fraudulent assertions"" of two organizations  ...**  (Comment: Just because the RMI government ""...has condemned the 'fraudulent assertions' ...of ...EnenKio...""  does that make it true? Why would you want to quote anything from a government that has been internationally criticized [and documented] time and again for fraud  abuse of human rights  outright theft and is in default on almost every financial obligation it has ever made? What purpose do you propose to serve by attacking a concerned group of dedicated people fighting for the very lives of Marshallese natives who have been overrun by foreign invaders  bathed in radiation from nuclear fallout and abused by their own corrupt government?)  **...namely the DOM and sister nation  the Kingdom of EnenKio (the Marshallese name for Wake Island) ...**  (Comment: Nothing could be further from the truth. we cannot speak for DOM  but as for the Kingdom  we don't even know what being a ""sister nation"" means and for you to make this categorically false statement is not only a blatant sign of ignorance of the state of EnenKio  it is a deceptive intrusion upon the sovereign  His Majesty King Remios  the sovereign of EnenKio and Eneen-Kio Atoll  and an inexplicable and irresponsible abuse of journalism. Doesn't anybody check sources anymore?)  Correction: The Kingdom of EnenKio is an independent sovereign state and  the same could be said for DOM.  **...claiming to represent the mid-Pacific nation amid an alleged investment scam according to an article in Agence France- Presse.** (Comment: The government of the Kingdom of EnenKio represents the people of EnenKio  who are forced to live in exile from Eneen-Kio Atoll  lands and seas that played a significant role in Marshallese culture for perhaps 2000 years. Furthermore  ""...an article in Agence France-Presse"" has no merit as it was authored by a source in the Marshall Islands government. My preceding comments apply. The Kingdom of EnenKio is not now and never has been engaged in an ""...investment scam..."". We have tried for many years to attract qualified investors and funding sources for programs that will not only benefit the people of EnenKio  but also will positively impact people around the globe. In fact  we are currently working with a former NASA Astronaut. One tool scammers have in their arsenal is to discredit visionary programs of legitimate entities so they can feed on carcasses of the ignorant. Many journalists use the same technique to sell their stories on sensationalism. Doesn't anybody check sources anymore?)  **The Marshall Islands foreign ministry has issued warnings to countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of either nation.**  (Comment: The Kingdom of EnenKio has made no ""fraudulent claims"" of which I am aware  and in my post  I am responsible for all published information. I would personally caution any ""..countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of..."" nations  companies or publications if I had credible proof to that effect. However  my preceding comments apply as to credibility of any RMI ministry source. Furthermore  the RMI has repeatedly attacked the credibility of His Majesty King Hermios  who happens to be the ancestral sovereign owner under Marshallese custom of over 1/3 of the land in the Marshall Islands  including recent attempts to sequester him against his will. We believe some officials in the RMI are afraid of what will happen to them if honesty and integrity returns to the administration of lands and programs to assist the people with their pressing needs and they no longer have their hands on the till. To perpetrate their jaundiced agenda is an irresponsible abuse of journalism.) **A Honolulu-based attorney created the ""Kingdom of EnenKio"" in the early 1990s.**  (Comment: Mr. Moore is not an Attorney  though he was living in Honolulu in the early 1990s.)  Correction: The Kingdom of EnenKio was established by decree of the  owner of Eneen-Kio Atoll [a.k.a. Enen-kio  Halcyon  Disclerta  Wake and 6-8 other names]  Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios  who then was Paramount Chief of the Northern Ratak atolls [he passed away in December 1998] and was fully recognized by the RMI government. He declared the sovereign state of EnenKio in 1994  whereupon the people chose him as their King over Eneen-Kio Atoll  ratified the Constitution and established government as a limited constitutional monarchy. **It was based on a power of attorney agreement with Marshall Islands paramount chief Mursel (sic) Hermios  which granted the attorney broad powers to act on his behalf.**  Correction: The establishment of the Kingdom of EnenKio was made  possible by Murjel's appointment of Mr. Robert Moore  the adopted brother of Hermios  Alab of Taongi Atoll and a private citizen  to the post of Minister Plenipotentiary. The document of appointment was also a Special Power of Attorney which granted Mr. Moore very specific instructions to do whatever was possible to expel the United States from Eneen-Kio Atoll and establish an independent state on Hermios' and the people's behalf.  **The Marshall Islands High Court has ruled the agreement invalid and ordered it nullified  which the ""kingdom"" has disputed.** (Comment: Since when is a Special Power of Attorney an ""agreement""? The Marshall Islands High Court has no record or knowledge of the Special Power of Attorney  except as has been publicized by the Kingdom of EnenKio  and certainly exercises no jurisdiction over Eneen-Kio Atoll  which lies over 100 miles north of lawful RMI boundaries. The RMI has no political or territorial jurisdiction over the islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll because the atoll  by any name you choose  was not incorporated into the RMI when it formed its government in 1979  nor was it subsequently incorporated by any act  law  mandate or otherwise of any present or former Iroijlaplap or Monarch of Eneen-Kio and any statement to the contrary is false  fraudulent and irresponsible.) Finally  I suggest you  as a journalist or publisher  do a little more research  not only into establishment and development of the Kingdom of EnenKio  but into the prehistoric history and more recent U.S. invasion of Eneen-Kio Atoll  properly named by 'Marshallese' centuries before arrival of colonial western powers and missionaries. Then I invite you to our Embassy in Honolulu to review the public files and documents mentioned above  all of which exist in hard copy (not in 'cyberspace') and most of which are referenced or published at our official web site. Be sure to view the documents at our Resource Center which show  in many cases  full-color digitized letters of correspondence with the 59 or so states in the world  many of which are first world. In closing  I would simply appeal to your presumed sense of morality and ethics and request the referenced article be amended or corrected and   if corrected elsewhere  that a link be provided to the relevant paragraph cited above in the article.  SKIP TO NEXT FILE TOP OF PAGE  June 3  1999- Sir: The following report was sent to me in which the author mentions the Kingdom of EnenKio (thank you for spelling 'EnenKio' correctly. The purpose of this letter below is to lodge a formal request for correction of false and misleading statements made by the author regarding the Kingdom of EnenKio.  ""Fantasy Island"" -- ""Melchizedek passport scam reveals how the Internet can take fraud to new frontiers"" By Bertil Lintner in Bangkok  December 10  1998: ""Determined not to give up  Pedley moved his fictional nation once again  this time to Taongi atoll in the Western Pacific. According to a Melchizedek press release  posted on its home page  Taongi was leased in 1997 under a treaty with representatives of ""the kingdom of EnenKio "" another only-in- cyberspace country  which in this case claims the U.S.-held Wake Island. In real life  Taongi is an uninhabited atoll in the Marshall Islands.""  http://www.feer.com/Restricted/index_corrections.html (link to article of December 24  1998: ""Fantasy Island""  disconnected as of 2/1/00) Response to the author: I am unable to locate the ""Melchizedek press release"" you cited  indicating that ""...Taongi was leased in 1997 under a treaty with representatives of ""the kingdom of EnenKio ..."". Such an act would be impossible and implausible as EnenKio has no legal authority or political jurisdiction over Taongi Atoll in the Marshall Islands. Further more  Melchizedek (DOM) is not so uninformed as to publicly advertise an illegal act in the midst of attempting to find a suitable land base for its people to administer their form of government.  The Kingdom of EnenKio did enter into a treaty with DOM on the 19th day of September  1997  but it did not convey a lease of land. It declared a state of peace and established diplomatic recognition between our governments. However  a prior agreement  signed in May 1997  which had nothing to do with the Kingdom of EnenKio  transferred Mr. Robert Moore's rights to develop Taongi from Mr. Moore to DOM. It did not convey a lease at that time and no such document is in existence. This was made possible because Mr. Moore is the Alab (one class of landowner) of Taongi and had a legal power of attorney pertaining to Taongi Atoll  from the principal landowner  Iroijlaplap (Paramount Chief) Murjel Hermios  who was aware of and supported the transaction. Consideration  if any  under the agreement was personally retained by Mr. Moore  who is also the adopted brother of Hermios. Now  please understand  that while Mr. Moore was acting in the latter case on his own behalf  and that of the future use and development of Taongi  which would have generated an income to Iroijlaplap Hermios  Mr. Moore wears another hat as Minister Plenipotentiary of the Kingdom of EnenKio. Iroijlaplap Hermios  also wore (he died in December 10  1998  the same date of your article) other hats: one as First Monarch  King of the Kingdom of EnenKio and one as owner in allodium of Eneen-Kio Atoll (a.k.a. Enen-kio  Halcyon  Disclerta  Wake and several other names). For you to state the Kingdom of EnenKio is ""...another only-in- cyberspace country...""  as you did in the above article  is not only a completely and categorically false statement  but it is a blatant sign of ignorance of the state of EnenKio. And  it is a blatant deceptive intrusion upon His Majesty King Hermios  the sovereign of EnenKio and Eneen-Kio Atoll  and an inexplicable and irresponsible abuse of your journalistic license -- unless  of course  your statement could be proved accurate. I suggest you do a little more research  not only into the establishment and development of the Kingdom of EnenKio  but into the prehistoric history and more recent U.S. invasion of Eneen-Kio Atoll  properly named by 'Marshallese' centuries before arrival of colonial western powers and missionaries. Then I invite you to our Embassy in Honolulu to review the public files  all of which exist in hard copy (not 'cyberspace') and most of which are referenced or published at our official web address: Be sure to view the documents at our Resource Center which show  in many cases  full-color digitized letters of correspondence with the 59 or so states in the world  many of which are first world.

SKIP TO NEXT FILE TOP OF PAGE  June 2  1999- Sir: The following statement (in quotes) was copied from one of your Footnotes to History -D and E (disconnected as of 12/1/00). ""Enenkio Atoll- In 1898  the United States annexed Wake Island  in the Marshall Islands of the western Pacific.

The protests took a sharper turn after the U.S. Congress in 1993 acknowledged the illegality a hundred years earlier of the establishment by Americans of the Republic of Hawai'i.

The Marshalls recognized this claim shortly after the nation gained its independence. In return for his services as Minister Plenipotentiary in the United States  Hermios granted American businessman Robert Moore land on Taongi Atoll in the northern Marshalls  which Moore has declared the Dominion of Melchizedek."" Comment: With all candor  I cannot figure how such straight forward facts such as we have presented to the public and over the Internet since 1994 could have possibly been construed into the above referenced text. While I am pleased to find you have apparently taken a very serious interest (unless your site is intended as some twisted joke  which I am assuming is not the case) in the history of the Kingdom of EnenKio  I am aghast at how distorted  erroneous and misleading your summary is. As a consequence of my service to His Majesty King Remios and the people of EnenKio  I will respectfully offer the following line by line correction. For your convenience  your text will be set off (with ""**"") in color:  **In 1898  the United States annexed Wake Island  in the Marshall Islands of the western Pacific.**  Correction: In 1898  the United States invaded Wake Island  the  northernmost atoll -- actually named Eneen-Kio centuries before western explorers arrived -- of the Ratak chain of Marshall Islands in Micronesia and the Central North Pacific Ocean. The Author responds: ""Rest assured that I did not mean to downplay the role of violence in the American acquisition of the territory."" **After the Marshalls became a U.S. Trust Territory  the traditional chiefs of the area agitated for recognition that Wake Island was a part of the Marianas chain  and pressed their historical claims to the atoll  called Enenkio locally.** Correction: Following W.W.II  the Trust Territories of the Pacific  which included the Marshall Islands  was placed under administration of the United States by the United Nations. While Eneen-Kio was well established as one of the Marshalls  the U.S. only knew it as Wake and  having lost many U.S. lives there in 1941 at the hands of Japanese invaders  kept control of it. In 1993  the Paramount Chief of the Ratak atolls pressed his clan's historical and lawful claim to the 3 islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll.  The Author responds: ""I don't see much conflict between the two versions here.""  **The U.S. government has consistently ignored these claims.** Correction: The U.S. government has consistently ignored claims from the Marshall Islands government  which failed to exert a claim during its move to independence in 1979  and from the former traditional landowners  including Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios. The Author responds: ""I will note this."" **The protests took a sharper turn after the U.S. Congress in 1993 acknowledged the illegality a hundred years earlier of the establishment by Americans of the Republic of Hawai'i.** Correction: The Eneen-Kio claims gained some new momentum after precedents were set by the U.S. Congress  when in 1993 they acknowledged the illegality of the 1893 overthrow of the Monarch of the Kingdom of Hawai'i by a group of American businessmen and U.S. Marines  and in the following year returned the island of Kaho'olawe to the Hawaiian People. **King Murjel Hermios  who is paramount chief of an archipelago in the northern Marshalls  declared Wake Island's independence in 1987.** Correction: King Murjel Hermios  who was Paramount Chief until his death in December 1998  declared the sovereign state of EnenKio in 1994  whereupon the people chose him as their King over Eneen-Kio Atoll  ratified the Constitution and established government as a limited constitutional monarchy.  The Author responds: ""I will make the necessary corrections here."" **The Marshalls recognized this claim shortly after the nation gained its independence. In return for his services as Minister Plenipotentiary in the United States  Hermios granted American businessman Robert Moore land on Taongi Atoll in the northern Marshalls  which Moore has declared the Dominion of Melchizedek.**  Correction: After the death of the First Monarch  his brother Remios  succeeded to the throne as Second Monarch and rules along with his brother  Crown Prince Lobadreo  over the Kingdom of EnenKio today. To continue the commentary: The parts left out were either wrong or have nothing to do with the history of the Kingdom of EnenKio itself. Since HM King Remios also succeeded to Iroijlaplap of the northern Ratak atolls of the Marshall Islands  he also has responsibilities over 10 atolls  2 islands and over 300 atoll islets. But that is another story  which has nothing directly to do with the Kingdom of EnenKio. I have offered this treatise in hopes that you will find the time to correct your site per my suggestions. Please feel free to contact me or view our pages at the address above. Thank you in advance for your attention and interest in this matter.  The Author responds: ""I imagine that you are asserting here that Moore's Melchizedek project (which can be located on the web through the Sources & Bibliography section of my web page) is non-existent. Be assured I will look further into\par this. Thank you again for your response  Captain Rydell. I should be posting a revised version of the page in the next week or so."" (June 7  1999)  SKIP TO NEXT FILE TOP OF PAGE June 1  1999: News Release Part One Background:  On May 21  1999  the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands posted a ""press release"" on the Internet at: http://www.yokwe.net/mboard/newsinfo/thread.cgi?67 0\cf0 (discontinued as of 12/1/00). The author  ""Mr. Joseph Biglar  Undersecretary""  is not known to us  has not heretofore communicated with the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio  nor with its Monarch  His Majesty King Remios  at any time and has no knowledge of any policies or state activities of EnenKio. There is no valid reason to assume that the said ""press release"" is indeed an official document. The Republic of the Marshall Islands has perfect knowledge that representatives of the Kingdom of EnenKio  headed by His Majesty King Remios  on the basis of his proper and lawful authority  have the right and obligation to speak in support of the interests of certain persons  many of whom happen to be Marshallese nationals residing in the Marshall Islands. Response to so-called ""Press Release"":  This unprovoked attack upon His Majesty King Remios  Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio  by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands is wholly false. It is also unjustifiably inflammatory and amounts to little more than an unquestionable confirmation of the predilection for infringement upon Marshallese sovereign rights exercised by the current administration of the Republic of the Marshall Islands  which has been confirmed by the U.S. State Department. (See: Human Rights Report) This public posting shall serve as constructive notice to the Marshall Islands Government that any attempt to interfere in the business of His Majesty King Remios  Iroijlaplap of the Northern Ratak atolls of the Marshall Islands  or any acts  decisions  mandates  announcements or directives thereby  shall be met with definitive responses equal to the degrees of contravention.  The RMI is unequivocally cognizant that the Kingdom of EnenKio: » » exists as a sovereign state as defined by the Montevideo Convention (1933).  » » was conceived as a separate independent state by its sovereign   Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios  in 1987.  » » was established by way of a public authority  the Constitution  of the Kingdom of EnenKio Atoll  ratified in 1994 by its people. » » has negotiated diplomatic and trade treaties with many other states  including the Dominion of Melchizedek » » has asserted political and territorial jurisdiction over islands and seas which lie entirely outside and well beyond the area defined as  - now quoting Mr. Biglar's statement - ""RMI geographical and political boundaries.""  » » exercises authorities founded upon prehistoric traditional and  matriarchal ancestral rights and titles bestowed  under the sacred heritage of Marshallese customary law (reinforced by the RMI Constitution)  upon the acknowledged Iroijlaplaps of the Northern Ratak atolls  whose authority is certainly not subject to scrutiny by Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands. » » has not subjugated  assigned or encumbered any of its political  jurisdiction within its defined territorial boundaries of islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll to the government or people of the Dominion of Melchizedek or to any other entity  including the Republic of the Marshall Islands.  Mr. Biglar is unequivocally cognizant that the Republic of the Marshall Islands:  » » also exists as a sovereign state  defined by the Montevideo  Convention (1933).  » » was conceived as a separate state by (UN) foreign governments   which included the United States  China and the USSR. » » was also established under a public authority  the Constitution of the Marshall Islands  ratified in 1979 by its people. » » has no relations with EnenKio that allows RMI knowledge of anything that is not also public information and no such public information respecting relations with the Dominion of Melchizedek has ever been disseminated to harm the RMI to be condemned by Mr. Biglar. » » has no political or territorial jurisdiction over the islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll  which was not incorporated into the RMI in 1979  nor subsequently incorporated by any act  law or mandate of any present or former Iroijlaplap or Monarch thereof and any statement to the contrary is fraudulent  as in the instant matter. » » exercises authorities founded upon the RMI Constitution  which does not incorporate nor authorize political jurisdiction over territorial boundaries that include the islands or seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll and any statement to the contrary is fraudulent  as in the instant matter. » » has refused to acknowledge the leadership of the Kingdom of  EnenKio in their every attempt to get the RMI government to mitigate the suffering of people residing in the Ratak atolls  under jurisdiction of Iroijlaplap Hermios  and the RMI has rejected every suggestion to coordinate prospective relief efforts through the said Iroijlaplap Hermios.  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands is steadfastly advised that any unilateral statements or actions by the administration of the Republic of the Marshall Islands which purport  seek or serve to diminish or question the credibility  existence or authority of the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio in the conduct of its affairs of state  without legitimate authentication by a court of competent jurisdiction  are hereafter to be taken as deliberate acts of aggression upon the Monarch of the Kingdom  His Majesty King Remios  as Head of State  the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio and its people  and will be countered with appropriate responsive measures.  Furthermore  in light of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands announcement concerning the Kingdom of EnenKio  your attention is respectfully directed to the following statement in the Preamble of the Constitution of the Marshall Islands  then you decide for yourself:  ""With this Constitution  we affirm our desire and right to live in peace and harmony  subscribing to the principles of democracy  sharing the aspirations of all other peoples for a free and peaceful world  and striving to do all we can to assist in achieving this goal."" On behalf of His Majesty King Remios  we  administrators of the Kingdom of EnenKio  have wholeheartedly agreed to pursue the same goal for a free and peaceful world and have made no effort to the contrary.

[Paragraph 4] Thus  it is now possible for an enterprising jurisdiction anywhere in the world to establish itself as an emerging OFC. The newest OFCs  e.g.  Niue and the Marshall Islands  are now sprouting in remote areas of the world  such as the Pacific. Even more ""remote"" are mere figments of fertile imaginations such as the Dominion of Malchizedek (sic) or The Kingdom of Enenkio Atol (sic)  both entirely fraudulent in intent and practice."" [note: OFC = Offshore Financial Center] Response: This unprovoked attack upon His Majesty King Remios  Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio  the sovereign state of EnenKio and its noble citizenry by the U.S. Department of State is a reprehensible categorically false challenge of the sovereignty of the Kingdom of EnenKio. It is also unjustifiably inflammatory and amounts to an unqualified felonious defamation of the international reputation of His Majesty King Remios  the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio and organs thereof.  The unmitigated audacity and arrogance of the United States to attempt to link the Kingdom of EnenKio with International Crime  narcotics trafficking  money laundering  tax evasion  international drug cartels  terrorists  bank fraud or any other sort of criminal activity  without even one microscopic fragment of substantive evidence to corroborate such deliberately nefarious statements is reprehensible in the least.

Furthermore  this matter will not be resolved until the President of the United States issues a formal apology to His Majesty King Remios  along with the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio  and the Congress of the United States initiates a thorough investigation into the abuses of power  subversion of natural rights and illegal occupation by the United States of the islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll. Congressional representatives to Hawaii  the nearest State of the United States to Eneen-Kio Atoll  and those of other states  have repeatedly been advised of the foregoing atrocities and conditions and have failed to respond in kind. The United States is obligated as the self-assured trustee of Pacific Island States in Micronesia to respond to the charges of ""ethnic cleansing"" and her responsibility to EnenKio is no less.

His successor is designated to be his brother  HRH Crown Prince Lobadreo Hermios. For further information  contact the State Secretary back on the home page. SKIP TO NEXT FILE TOP OF PAGE  March 1999 -- Comments to readers from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Subject: A ""State of War"" Declaration The Kingdom of EnenKio recognizes that an unresolved conflict of interests exists between it and the United States Government.  The United States government  admittedly at a time of colonial expansionism  appears to have violated the laws of nature and The Law of Nations in ""taking possession"" of sovereign property in the Northern Ratak State  which then had formal treaties with the Republic of Germany.  The explicitly immoral and illegal 1899 seizure of Marshallese homeland by agents of the federal government was the start of present day sentiments of deprivation of rights and dispossession of lands felt by many Marshallese.  Because of continual neglect misrepresentation and outright exploitation  these scars on Marshallese society have not healed. Thus a current state of adversity exists.  Following four years of attempts to cause the United States to evaluate the plight of the Marshallese of the Northern Ratak imposed by its actions with respect to Wake Island  the government of EnenKio  on behalf of the Marshallese King  issued the ""'State of War'  a Declaration"" and broadcast it to the world.  The people were displaced from their native lands and kept as virtual prisoners of war  not by virtue of being kept in  but by virtue of being kept out.  It was through this pragmatic initiative that the Kingdom of EnenKio solicited support to heal the wounds inflicted upon the people and peacefully restore what was wrongfully taken from the ancestors of the Ratak Paramount Chief  King Murjel Hermios. In retrospect  the Declaration has had little visible effect.  While a state of adversity does exist  the hope for American recognition of past wrongs remains on the horizon.  The Kingdom of EnenKio does not condone nor tacitly sanction any act of belligerence by any person or agent of any government.  Such unnecessary means would diminish any hope of mutual reconciliation and could diplomatically undermine the cause of peace within the family of nations.  The Kingdom of EnenKio also does not wish to see any further damage to the remnant happiness of the Marshallese people.  While the Kingdom of EnenKio continues to seek accountability of the U.S. Congress to obey its own laws  to conform to the UN Charter  conventions of the United Nations relating to self-determination  preservation of human rights and protection against human rights abuses  it believes accountability requires the U.S. to meet the pleas of the people oppressed by the conditions of this adversity.  The refusal of  the U.S. to meet its obligations  even to the extent that a simple discussion for resolution is held over the subject matter with representatives for the affected parties  perpetuates the adversity  turns a cold shoulder to the facts of abuse and ignores the rights of the Marshallese people to whom the U.S. pledged in good faith to execute the 1947 mandates of the United Nations and its members.  Your understanding is appreciated.   SKIP TO NEXT FILE TOP OF PAGE December 19  1998: News Release  Subject: Death of the Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio  The government has declared a period of national mourning on the occasion of the death of the first Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio  His Majesty King Murjel Hermios. Embassies  missions and regional posts are instructed to display the flag at half-staff until 11 January 1999. Memorial services  held in the Marshall Islands where HM Hermios made his home  mark the passing of one of the most unpretentious of traditional Marshallese leaders. His remains will be interred in a family plot on one of the outer islands he so loved. Irooj Hermios was Head of State of the Kingdom of EnenKio  revered as Monarch over the islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll  esteemed as Iroijlaplap and High Chief of the Northern atolls of the Ratak Archipelago  beloved as our brother and trusted as a friend. His successor as Iroijlaplap is to be formally named by a Council of traditional leaders. Selection of a successor to the Monarchy of the Kingdom is in process and will be announced at a later date. In the interim  a Reagent will serve as Head of State. HM Hermios followed a long line of matriarchal predecessors as Iroijlaplap. Aboriginal inhabitants of the islands today known as the Marshalls  part of Micronesia in the North Pacific Ocean and first discovered by European seamen in the 16th Century  were found to have a well-developed societal structure. Many nations have since  mostly by force  prevailed over the Marshall Islands  imposed unaccustomed western ideals upon her populace and ravaged her islands of resources and beauty. Today this area is commonly known as Wake atoll and is illegally occupied by the federal government of the United States. In one of the most courageous acts in recent times  Irooj Hermios clearly understood he had a mission to succeed where his predecessors in interest had failed to secure the islands  seas and lagoon of Eneen-Kio Atoll for his beloved people. (The account of his acts to establish the Kingdom of EnenKio as an island state  independent of the governments of the Marshalls and the United States  may be researched at the official Internet site. On behalf of the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio  we are extremely grateful for his dedication to the people of the Marshall Islands and are personally moved by the memory of a man who will surely one day be recognized as having a legacy of furthering the interests of his people by the setting of processes in motion to re-establish Marshallese domination over Eneen-Kio Atoll. We are saddened that our brother has passed without his seeing the fruits of his devotion to Marshallese ancestry and traditions. In lieu of flowers  mourners may contact the mission at the address above or call (808) 373-9254. Sincerest best wishes for the holiday season and the coming New Year are extended to all in Peace. News Article  SKIP TO NEXT FILE TOP OF PAGE  July 14  1998: Communiqué to Correspondents Recent articles defaming the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio have been maliciously published under the guise of a Marshall Islands government warning against ""fraudulent claims"". We have once more admonished the writer of the articles in the Marshall Islands for disregarding indisputable facts which clearly discredit his biased report. We urge you to disregard all discourse in the media regarding the Kingdom of EnenKio which are not validated. To that end  you are cordially invited to contact this office with your specific questions or concerns. For your advice  the following statement was issued by the State Secretary of the Kingdom in reply: The Kingdom has never knowingly made any fraudulent claim whatsoever. No claim we have made has ever been shown to be fraudulent  nor has any claim ever come under or faltered from a challenge by anyone anywhere in the world. We are working vigorously to regain occupation of the ancestral property of HM King Hermios  to resolve the virtual ""state of war"" that exists with the United States government and to be accepted as an honorable state among nations.  The Kingdom does not pretend to be (quoting from the report) ""asserting authority over land ...within the geographical and political boundaries..."" of the RMI. We are however striving to expel the armed imperialistic invasion forces of the United States from the shores of Eneen-Kio Atoll so natural Marshallese supremacy can be re-establish there. As to allegations of fraud and constitutional violation  no one has dared to come forward with any such a charge. We say  let the issue be played out in the People's venue for the record  not in a libelous weekly publication. While we do not wear our brief history on our shirtsleeves  our raison d'être is clearly mandated in the Preamble to  the Constitution of EnenKio  which can be seen at our web site: http://www.enenkio.wakeisland.org  Referencing the news article in the Marshall Islands Journal entitled ""Kingdom of EnenKio sets up in New Zealand "" of May 1st  the editor was advised  contrary to his report  that neither passports nor driver licenses can be purchased from the Kingdom's web site. The Kingdom of EnenKio DOES NOT SELL PASSPORTS! If you have evidence to the contrary  our Foreign Ministry would appreciate your furnishing it to them so steps can be taken immediately to investigate the matter. You are advised if anyone sells or offers to sell an EnenKio passport  that such an act is patently illegal.  The published statement  ""The group ...claims to represent Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios and the atolls of the Ratak chain...""  is wholly false. I have explained this matter to the editor on several prior occasions and ample information is available at our Internet site to refute the statement. The Kingdom does not represent any area outside of its territorial boundaries  as the Ratak atolls surely are. Contrary to their libelous statements  the Kingdom of EnenKio was not ""created"" by Robert Moore and he is not a ""Honolulu-based attorney."" HM King Murjel Hermios is the acknowledged hereditary Iroijlaplap of the northern Ratak atolls and is also First Monarch of the Kingdom  not of his own choice  but by a legal process and free choice of our citizens who participated in the founding of the nation in 1994. Such a noble and peaceful beginning is not too uncommon in world history. ""Enenkio"" [sic] (actually Enen-kio or Eneen-Kio  in reference to the atoll itself) is the first Marshallese name for a Marshallese atoll located roughly 300 miles north of Bok-ak (Taongi) Atoll. ""Wake"" is a fictitious moniker applied to the re-discovered Eneen-Kio Atoll by unknown western society writers.  SKIP TO NEXT FILE TOP OF PAGE May 4  1997: News Release  Subject: Issuance of Gold Stamps  The government of the Kingdom of EnenKio proudly announces commissioning of its Inaugural Issue of Gold Stamps. This announcement  made at the First Sunday Hawaii Stamp  Coin and Postcard Show May 4th  was the first pre-publication public notice of the issuance of Gold Stamps by the Kingdom. Stamps are expected to be off the presses by early June 1997. First day covers with new stamps affixed and postmarked official ""First Day of Issue"" by the Kingdom will be available for a limited time following the dates of release. Distributors  dealers and collectors are encouraged sign up as a charter member of the EnenKio Philatelic Mint mailing list.  BACKGROUND - The Kingdom was established in March 1993  and the government was chosen by the people  who then ratified the constitution in September 1994. However  due to U.S. military activities on the island and the presence of armed occupation forces  the government of the Kingdom lingers in ""exile"". Several nations have extended recognition of the sovereignty of the Kingdom  documents of citizenship are being issued and legations are located in Europe  South America  USA and elsewhere.  A NATION IN CONFLICT - The land in question  commonly known as Wake Island  is actually an atoll comprised of three small islands assigned names of westerners who visited them: Wake  Wilkes and Peale. Few people in the world today are aware that the native discoverers who named the atoll Eneen-Kio lived in the Marshall Islands  exercised constant jurisdiction and made regular use of it as a living food pantry and cultural site. By way of developing the atoll as a nation  the government is asserting that it is the indisputable holder of allodial title to ""Wake"" atoll and has the right to exercise its sovereignty at the will of the people. The United States of America began in a similar fashion not with a peaceful transition from colonial status. Lawful return of the land is grounded upon the legal precedent set by Congressional apology to Hawaiians for the 1893 overthrow of the Monarchy.  ""STATE OF WAR"" - By way of an official March 1997 Declaration sent to top U.S. officials  the Kingdom of EnenKio has acknowledged that a virtual ""state of war"" now exists over the islands on account of the blatant acts of aggression and illegal armed invasions by troops from United States warships. The primary objective of the notice was to request a Congressional investigation into actual events and related factors surrounding the federal seizure of islands in the North Pacific Ocean by the United States. Calls to end U.S. operations  vacate the atoll and negotiate return of the islands to jurisdiction of the Kingdom have fallen on deaf ears. Despite repeated notices  letters and legal advertising  all major news media have consistently ignored the events and failed in their duty bring forth the truth to the people of the world regarding alleged incidents of piracy  waste and human rights violations by federal agents of the United States government. INAUGURAL ISSUE - The Gold Stamps are based on events of the past and dreams for the future of peace in the global community as the millennium nears. For that reason  the universal gold standard was chosen as the basis for evaluation. Since the relative value of gold in world markets varies according to the value and stability of national currency units  the stamps will similarly reflect changes in price when purchased with any particular currency. However  the real or intrinsic value of the stamps will remain as constant as gold. The extrinsic value will be determined by philatelic collectors around the world. Note: Stamps are printed on paper stock  do not contain gold metal and are not intended for use as money.  CLOSING COMMENTS - The government of the Kingdom appeals to all people from every peaceable nation in the world to recognize the Kingdom of EnenKio as a sovereign nation promoting peace in the Pacific region. In doing so  it seeks a peaceful resolution o f the ""state of war"" with the federal government of the United States and asks that everyone with human rights concerns use their influence accordingly. The proceeds from the sale of Gold Stamps will help fund the restoration of the Kingdom and end the conflict in peace.  SKIP TO NEXT FILE TOP OF PAGE March 31  1997: News Release  An official document entitled A Declaration  was sent March 22 to top Executive and Legislative officials in the federal government of the United States  including selected Cabinet members. The document asserts that: ""A STATE OF WAR EXISTS OVER THE KINGDOM OF ENENKIO ATOLL BY WAY OF ACTS BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES."" This is the most recent attempt to captivate the attention of the federal government. One of the primary objectives of this action is to bring about a Congressional investigation into the true events and factors surrounding the illegal seizure of islands in the North Pacific Ocean by the United States.  This latest position statement is one in a succession of dozens of disclosures  statements  letters and legal actions taken since the government of the Kingdom was established in March 1993  each with similar objectives. Calls for the U.S. to cease operations  vacate the premises  negotiate return of the island to the King  apologize and compensate him for use  abuse and illegal hold-over following legal action have all failed to receive cognizance or reply from the federal government. Likewise  despite repeated notices  letters and legal announcements  major news media have consistently ignored the events and failed in their duty bring forth the truth to the people of the world regarding the alleged piracy  arrogance and human rights violations by the United States.  The land in question  commonly called Wake Island  is comprised of three small islands  Wake  Wilkes and Peale  named by ""Western explorers"" for Western persons. What of the native discoverers? The crux of the issue is that despite the passage of ownership via a complex Matriarchal land tenure system for over two millennia with jurisdiction by the aboriginal chiefs of the Northern Ratak atolls of Marshall Islands  the United States seems to believe it is justified in having seized the atoll in 1898  and again in1899. Historical records reveal that the multiple landings by United States warships  en route to the Philippines on war missions  and subsequent Congressional action  were the sole basis of the U.S. claim. The motivation was said to be for the establishment of a cable station to improve communications with its marauding troops in the East. Such a station was never established at Wake Island. It was destined to become a military installation.  However  formal protests of the seizure was sent to the U.S. President by the German Consul in the Marshall Islands and some measure of correspondence followed. But since the U.S. abandoned the area without establishing a colony or cable station and Germany was defeated in the first World War  the objections fell into oblivion. It is understood from written accounts of oral Marshallese culture and traditions  that jurisdiction and use of the atoll by natives continued. The U.S. did not establish a settlement there until  under a lease in 1934  the CAA (predecessor of the FAA) allowed Pan American Airways to build a base for its fleet of trans-pacific seaplanes. Clearly  the so-called annexation by the U.S. is grossly flawed  the occupation patently illegal and its ""ownership"" is held therefore to be wholly invalid. When the U.S. Congress apologized for the overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy in 1993 and the U.S. Navy subsequently returned culturally significant land to the ""natives"" of Hawaii  a landmark legal precedent was thus set for comparable action with respect to the return of Wake Island. The islands of Eneen-Kio  as the northernmost atoll in the Ratak chain  played a very significant role in the culture and religion of Micronesians living in the more ""hospitable"" islands of the Marshall group. While not being used for Navy target practice as Kaho'olawe was  the use of the islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll and the military mission at Wake Airfield are decidedly without substantial merit and whereby activities take place in secrecy  devoid of scrutiny  oversight or quintessential knowledge by the American public. Even after cultural intervention in the mid 1800s by Christian Missionaries  natives continued to use Eneen-Kio  authority to go there being issued by the Ratak Iroijlaplap (Paramount Chief). King Murjel Hermios holds that title today. By way of developing the atoll in sovereignty as a nation  the government is thereby indisputable holder of the allodial title to Wake Island. The U.S. cannot produce a title. The Hermios ancestral lineage  passage of title through the ages from aboriginal inhabitants and discoverers  who gave the atoll its Marshallese name  their continual use and legacy of jurisdiction secures the rights of ownership.  Upon the basis of events and actions by the United States  the administration of the Kingdom of EnenKio  by virtue of the Declaration  ""yields to the recognition that a State of War"" exists over the island nation. This is not  however  to be viewed as a waiver of rights or unconditional surrender. Sovereignty and independence of the Kingdom  over all other claims  is forthrightly reasserted. The belief is that truth and law is on the side of the Kingdom and that reckless abuse of power and a trail of human rights violations are chronicled upon the record of U.S. ""ownership"" and occupation. Native North Americans are all too well acquainted with this brand of federal brutality when it comes to seizure of land and denial of rights. In the Declaration  demands are made as follows: » » ""...to come to the table of peace to negotiate an honorable  accord for the survivors of the said STATE OF WAR..."". » » ""If unwilling to voluntarily negotiate for peace  to submit to Impartial international arbitration of the terms for surrender and WAR reparations to citizens.""  » » ""...to cease and desist  effective immediately  all and every  action of every kind in or on EnenKio Atoll or within the 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone...""  » » ""...to pay that certain debt  perfected and established in commerce by failure the Department of the Interior » » ""...to lawfully respond to proper legal notices of more than TWENTY-SEVEN consecutive months and most recently referenced by a Certified Invoice  No. 97-US-03  dated March 10  1997  for which it is obligated to pay."" » » That the ""...Congress of the United States is obliged to immediately impanel an impartial body for the purpose of investigating the atrocities committed in the case of the violations of human rights and due process..."".  The government of the Kingdom solicits every other sovereign peaceable nation in the world to give effective and adequate recognition to the Kingdom of EnenKio Atoll as an Independent Nation under God. It seeks a peaceful resolution of the state of war with the federal government of the United States and asks them to use their influence accordingly. Appeals are being made to the United Nations. News Article SKIP TO NEXT FILE TOP OF PAGE  February 6  1995: News Release  On behalf of His Majesty  King Murjel Hermios  Monarch of EnenKio Atoll  titular head of State  Paramount Chief (Iroijlaplap) of the northern atolls of the Ratak archipelago of Pacific Ocean Islands of the Marshall Islands  I bid you a warm Marshallese greeting -- Yokwe! The purpose of this notice is twofold: First  to admonish those of you to whom word of the referenced issues were made known  then failed to take action; Second  to encourage you to whom this presents to take appropriate action in disseminating reports on this issue. As long as you remain quiet  safely removed from the potential controversy insidiously lurking beneath the surface of one issue about which the federal government of the United States remains resolutely silent  your anonymity and that of your publication is well served. Summary of Events 1993-94: Two official press releases have been made regarding the establishment of a new island nation in the Pacific Ocean  EnenKio  formerly known as Wake Island. The first was issued on February 25  1994. It followed two announcements: 1) officials of the US Air Force at Hickam AFB  Hawaii said in articles published New Year's Eve and Day in both Honolulu newspapers that the USAF no longer wanted to maintain Wake Island airfield and wanted to turn it over to Interior Department or another military organization by 1 February and abandon it by 1 October  1994;  2) US Army Space and Strategic Defense Command of Huntsville  Alabama issued an Environmental Impact Assessment for a proposed missile launch program out of Wake Island; part of the ""star wars"" program  I am led to believe.  An emergency meeting of the leaders of the future nation of EnenKio was held and it was decided that earlier efforts to bring the atoll under the jurisdiction of Hawaii would be abandoned in favor of affirmation of independence  thus seeking self-rule under the natural landowner as king. Letters to Mr. Clinton  members of Congress  U.S. Army and the first press release proclaimed the status of ownership of EnenKio (Wake I.  Peale I.  Wilkes I.)  denounced the Army's so-called ""no significant impact"" scheme to fire more than 800 rockets of an undisclosed nature into and over the waters of the Marshall Islands (including its sanctuaries for turtles and birds) and asserted rightful ownership claims.  On March 21  1994  a formal resolution was executed establishing the nation of EnenKio as an independent nation under the authority of His Majesty Murjel Hermios  who had granted special power of attorney to Mr. Robert Moore  appointed Minister Plenipotentiary. The Constitution  Succession Act and other documents were thereafter drafted. On September 30th  a formal Declaration of Sovereignty was signed into law by Ministers and selected delegate citizens  believing (as did the USA founding fathers) that such power was an inherent right of the people. It declared the Kingdom of EnenKio a sovereign independent peaceful nation  it acknowledged His Majesty  King Murjel Hermios as owner in allodium of the atoll  accepted him as Head of State and embraced the Constitution as the founding document for a form of democratic government.  Documents and letters were sent to numerous nations of the world proclaiming the above actions. Formal documents of recognition were presented  offer of diplomatic ties made and support for reciprocation requested. Copies of pertinent documents were forwarded to the United Nations  UN Security Council  NATO  South Pacific Commission and others. Letters of personal appeal were sent to UN leaders. A special request for protection and assistance was sent to the UN Security Council. On October 10th  a commercial affidavit and demand for payment was sent via certified mail to federal officers of the United States regarding the illegal January 17  1899 seizure  under force of arms  of the islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll  the adverse occupation and continued disregard of international Human rights law  UN Charter terms and terms of the Compact of Free Association with the Republic of the Marshall Islands (Public Law 99-239; January 14  1986). Having acknowledged receipt and failing to respond within a reasonable time  the U.S. is now in default under commercial law  owing in excess of US$100 million. The second official press release was issued on November 21  1994  relating the preceding events. Of all the agencies to whom it was sent  only two  the Marshall Islands Journal  a weekly newspaper and Islands Business Pacific magazine are known to have mentioned the story  then only briefly.  Request for Media Response:  The thirst of the media for copy on topics outside of natural calamities  treed cats and daily courtroom chronicles of violence and deception seems seriously lacking. Is not the peaceful beginning of a new nation news any more? Is not the restoration of native rights of an aboriginal society whose roots reach into antiquity (to before the birth of Jesus) worth a little journalistic investigation? How about suspicions of insidious military-sanctioned activity which threatens the security and peaceful existence of nations of the Pacific in the name of ""world leadership""? Or is it world domination? People of EnenKio have a few simple requests of you  the media  in an effort to draw international attention to this issue and thereby  hopefully shorten the delay in regaining active occupation of islands of their ancestral heritage:  1. Investigate and verify the circumstances of the illegal armed invasion supported by U.S. expansionism and subsequent improper annexation of the sacred islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll  then being utilized by sailors  hunters and chiefs of the Marshallese civilization and for at least 2000 years prior to the 1899 fiasco. (Note: These facts and validity of the Hermios claim are a matter of historical record  not a fabrication.)  2. Investigate and/or verify the circumstances of any evidence of specific beneficial use and U.S. policy  past and present  or the lack thereof  with regard to the role of EnenKio . (Note: It is my understanding Wake was ""decommissioned"" after the so-called ""processing"" of thousands of South Vietnamese refugees in the late 1970s).  3. Reflect on the contrasting history of U.S. occupation  war  technological advances  in light of modern attitudes about misdeeds against native peoples and the willingness of our people to develop serious national economic programs for the benefit of all mankind.  4. Respectfully and conscientiously broadcast the credibility of the king's claim of allodial title  the declaration of rights of the citizens of EnenKio to self-determination and the commitment by their government and leaders to promulgate their mandates in a responsible and fiscal manner.  5. Bring to light U.S. strategy with regard to the implementation of questionable and costly pet programs involving nuclear proliferation  offensive/defensive weapon systems  clandestine military research  environmental pollution and whatever else is going on there. (Note: Congress and certain federal agencies have promoted use of Wake Island and environs as platform for launching and testing hundreds of rockets and missiles  a federal prison for drug offenders and other less publicized projects.)  6. Fully disclose to the people of the United States U.S. strategy with regard to the denial of possession of lawful title to Eneen-Kio Atoll by King Hermios as a consequence of natural inheritance via time-honored and respected Marshallese matriarchal traditions  disregard for Human rights protected under international law  United Nations Charter and conventions and the U.S. Compact with the Marshall Islands and refusal to acknowledge liability for acts of piracy on the high seas of military and colonial expansionism of the nineteenth century. (Note: U.S. apology for the illegal armed overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy the prior year and the return of the Hawaiian island  Kaho'olawe  also of religious significance  has set precedents for the action demanded by EnenKio citizens.)  Parting Shot:  What truly concerns me is the cavalier attitude of government in general  the U.S. federal government more precisely  which somehow behaves as if endowed by a divinely inspired alchemy that conveys the right to rearrange lands  cultures and economics with out the slightest inclination to counsel with those people most concerned. Such an approach might be expected in some dictatorship in some distant corner of the globe  but considering its present source  it is downright alarming. It is worthwhile to mention here that despite a prominent trail left over the course of more than two years  letters  reports  forms  published articles  press releases  legal notices  documents and virtually every action initiated by those representing King Hermios have escaped official response from officers of the U.S. federal government. Our not-too-distant past is replete with examples of the insatiable thirst of western ""civilized"" nations for doctrines faithful to the cry of ""manifest destiny"" which clearly marked American foreign policy of a century ago. If this current trend signifies a resurgence  it can only be considered a giant leap backward  considering the flimsy record of American attempts at ""fixing up the world"". The title of ownership and inheritance of Eneen-Kio Atoll pre-dates formation of the United States by two centuries or more. It is time the significance of native cultures and recognition of their right to self-determination is elevated from matters of scientific discourse to mainstream political involvement in determining the future course of human endeavor. People have a right to know; the media a responsibility to show them. In conclusion  I reiterate that our focus  from my point of view  is one  not so much of opposition to the ominous might of U.S. political philosophy and military prowess  but of asserting the moral imperatives for correcting errors of the past  supporting restoration of Human cultural dignity and the unobstructed observance of God-given individual rights. Thank you for your support and cooperation in helping end the siege and forced exile of our proud citizenry.  TOP OF PAGE November 21  1994: News Release  In a bid to regain occupation of that portion of his ancestral lands which include Wake Island  site of a U.S. military outpost  His Majesty  King Murjel Hermios  through his legal representative  Minister Plenipotentiary  Robert Moore  the U.S. has been given the boot out of Wake Island. Moore served legal notice on top U.S. government officials in October 1994 to cease all activity and leave the islands. The filing came on the heels of a five-year struggle to gain recognition of the illegal seizure of islands (owned by predecessors of King Hermios) by the gun boat  USS Bennington in 1899.  The legal document  a Commercial Affidavit  Declaration of Fair Value and Demand for Payment  was served under recognized principles of Common Law and International Commercial Codes. It details the specifics of King Hermios' ancestral rights to Wake Island  the illegality of the U.S. claim and violations of native laws  International Agreements and human rights during their 95-year hold on the Hermios property. It also establishes default  recognized under law  by reason of failure to answer the sworn claims  thereby allowing the Hermios claim to stand valid before the law as unchallenged. Under those claims  demand was made for payment of 94.7 million dollars for past use of the land. Continued use and holdover of the atoll will add 5 million dollars per month through 1995.  While putting forth the appearance of advocating human rights  U.S. officials continue to ignore issues right in their own backyard which keep King Hermios and the citizens of EnenKio living in compulsory exile.  Eneen-Kio Atoll  a name derived from Marshallese traditions involving a small orange (kio) flower found there  is made up of 3 islands  including Wake. Predecessors in interest of King Hermios  aboriginal chiefs and islanders sailed native canoes to Eneen-Kio Atoll for religious and cultural purposes as much as 500 years BC. During the colonial invasion of Pacific islands  western traders and explorers consistently ignored the native traditions and rights of the real discoverers of those fragile and isolated bits of sand  the islanders themselves. A case in point is in that of the Hawaiians  who recently gained an apology from the U.S. Congress and President Bill Clinton for the illegal U.S. government overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy. King Hermios is presently acknowledged as the hereditary Paramount Chief (Iroijlaplap) of all the Northern Atolls of the Ratak Archipelago of the Marshall Islands  which terminates to the north  beyond Eneen-Kio Atoll. Mr. Moore has full authority to act on the King's behalf to rid the islands of their illegal and unwanted Occupation Forces in favor of restoring the King's assertion of his native allodial rights. Most recently occupying and holding the islands are agents of the U.S. Air Force command  15th Logistics Group  Hickam AFB  Hawaii. Nearly identical articles published in the Star Bulletin and Honolulu Advertiser on December 31  1993 and January 1  1994 headlined: ""Air Force willing to give up its hold on Wake Island"" and stated: ""Not much activity there anymore  so the Air Force wants to give up control"". According to some theories thought to have reliable foundation  private entities or other government agencies are fighting for control behind a stonewall of apathy  denial and contempt for traditional ancestral heritage of King Hermios  his predecessors and people. Mr. Moore is also charged with the responsibility of bringing the nation under active jurisdiction of its own independent government  to initiate and administer to its citizens  promote economic development and to direct all affairs of State. The democratic government is established as a limited constitutional monarchy and is being directed by its Executive Council.  Since 1987  despite repeated efforts to resolve the conflict and the effects of a stroke  Mr. Moore has been unsuccessful in getting any substantive reply from officers of the United States  military officers and members of Congress. The following is a summary of some of the recent letters  inquiries and statements of claims made on behalf of the lawful and rightful landowner  King Murjel Hermios: » » Formal letters to President Clinton and Vice-President Al Gore in February 1993  requesting consideration under programs promised in their campaign for economic conversion of old military bases were ignored. As a military base  Wake Airfield was ""decommissioned"" more than a decade ago.  » » In response to the Environmental Assessment of the proposed  Theater Missile Defense Rocket Launch Activities  formal letters of protest sent to the Pentagon and U.S. Army officials  who contemplated launching hundreds of missiles from Wake Island over several years into the waters of the Marshall Islands  went unanswered. » » Letters to members of the U.S. Congress protesting rocket launch activities and requesting help went unanswered. » » A Resolution dated March 21  1994 was signed which declared the status of EnenKio to be that of an independent nation under the administrative jurisdiction of King Murjel Hermios. It was likewise ignored. After waiting for more than 580 days since ""formal"" notification of the declared status of EnenKio and having heard no objection from the United States  Mr. Moore assembled the Ministers of the Executive Council. They  along with a few involved citizens living in exile and denied access to Eneen-Kio  formally passed and signed the Declaration of Sovereignty on September 30  1994. They also accepted the draft of the Constitution which establishes the democratic principles of government recognizing His Majesty  King Murjel Hermios as Head of State and his family as the First Royal Family of EnenKio . While the King and his people bear no ill will against the multitudes of foreign invaders of Eneen-Kio Atoll  which over the centuries included agents of the Emperor of Japan  the Emperor of Germany  and the King of Spain  they believe the time has come to acknowledge the errors of the past  correct the conditions thereby produced and move on into the future in support of the sacred principals of Truth  Honor and Peace. Those principals are embodied in the Constitutions of EnenKio and of the United States. Those tenets were likewise embodied  affirmed and ratified by the U.S. Congress in Public Law 99-239 (Jan. 14  1986)  signed by President Ronald Reagan as the Compact of Free Association with the Marshall Islands and Federated States of Micronesia. The compact acknowledges superiority of all Marshallese ""natural"" rights  including those of ownership and use of land.

(v1.52f) Business Importance: Normal Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit  It was the Spring of 1979.    I was just a tall  goofy looking kid in middle school with buck-teeth and freckles.  Each day in the cafeteria  I walked from table to table ...  Stealing other kids' lunch money.  No  I didn't rob them with a gun or a knife - I just made them a little deal.  ""Let me borrow two dollars today "" I said  ""and I'll bring you five dollars next week.""  The investment was too good to pass up  and other kids were throwing their lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes.  Of course  when ""next week"" rolled around and I couldn't pony up the cash  I promised to pay them even more the week after that  if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit  longer.  Eventually the end of the year came and went  high school started and with it came girls  and homework  and parties  and sports  and those poor kids from eighth grade had more  things on their mind than last year's lunch money.  I made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid  and I didn't even get beat up.  Hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market  secrets you will ever learn.  First of all  greed is your number one enemy. You're not going to turn $2 into $5 in a week  so cash out when you're ahead.  Don't wait for the boat to sink before  grabbing the lifejacket.  Second  never trust an investment adviser of any kind. They are looking out for their own money  not yours.  The ""professionals""  those stuffy investment counselors and money managers  will always tell you that the best time to buy is NOW.  According to those guys  the longer you keep your money in the market  the more money you're going to make. Ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is ""NEVER"".    In a sense  they are right.  If you put $250 000 in an index fund right now  you'll probably have over a million dollars in thirty or forty years.  But here's the problem:  Do you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich?  Hell no!  You want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It's hard to make use of your fortune when you're seventy years old  in a wheelchair.  If you could make a million dollars in the next few years  what would you do with it?  Where would you travel?  What kind of car would you buy?    The fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich.  If your goal is to make quick profits in the market  volatility is your ally  and stability your enemy.  You want to see those large upswings  two hundred points in a day  followed by the four hundred point crash a week later.  You don't care if the market went up or down 20% this year as long it was UNSTABLE.  That's how you're going to make the  money.  What I'm talking about here is day trading.    My father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks  and he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years  he makes money.   The day trader buys or sells 5 000 shares of XYZ for a $25 000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade.  He acts quickly  taking  advantage of all the information at his disposal about a  certain stock  and estimating whether it will go up or  down within hours  sometimes within minutes.    I can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing  amounts of money at it.  It's not rocket science  and you  only need to learn a few basic principles to get started.  Society would have you believe that successful trading is  complicated and requires formal training.    The truth is  wealthy people use very simple investment  strategies to make money.    Popular media and investment professionals portray successful trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing ring.  They don't want the competetion - and they sure as hell don't want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm to execute a trade for which they'd charge you forty or fifty  dollars.  They make their money only if you believe two lies:  1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average  person.  2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high  commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks  per trade.  Here is what the financial gurus in today's society absolutely  positively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ...  The strategies for profitable day trading are in fact so simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend a few hours of studying.    After reading over 200 financial books and publications during the past decade  and after using day trading to successfully make more than four million dollars in the stock market  I've learned the following lessons:  ** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple.  ** Anyone can do it.  ** It only takes a few hours to learn.  When I discovered the secret to day trading  I didn't become wealthy overnight.  If you want instant cash  drive to Wal-mart.  Buy a ski mask and a shotgun  and rob your local bank. The  only way to get rich  quick or otherwise  is through hard work  knowledge  and determination.  After learning the fundamentals of day trading  I started  practicing the trading art itself  and the first few weeks brought modest gains.  The next few months gave me the practical experience I needed to really earn a living  and I was pulling close to a six figure income. In less than three years with no  formal financial training  minimal effort and only moderate risk  I had made my first million.  The knowledge that I gained  during those formative trading years I am willing to share with you in my new book  the Master Trader.  You will learn from my mistakes  and from my successes  as I teach you the simple  secret formula for day trading that I've used profitably year after year.  The income of the day trader can be staggering.  Thousands  even  hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within minutes.  The difference between making money and losing your  shirt is simply this: knowledge.  I will provide that knowledge  and I will give you a winning edge at this high-stakes game.   Average Income of a Day Trader:  5% average an income in excess of $500 000 per year 22% average an income in excess of $250 000 per year 35% average an income in excess of $100 000 per year.  27% average an income between $50 000 and $99 999 per year  11% average an income between $20 000 and $49 999 per year   After reading the Master Trader  you will discover extremely  profitable  simple yet powerful trading methods that give  you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you  win DESPITE the current market weakness.   Here is just a snippet of what I will teach you:  *** Make money whether a stock goes up or down.   *** Learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds.   *** Learn exactly what stocks to trade  the exact price to  buy them and the exact price to sell them.    *** Save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the  mistakes beginners make.   *** Learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money  consistently in every market!    *** Learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance  for great success.    *** Profit on huge intraday price swings.   *** Make money on the biggest news stories.   *** Actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum returns.    *** Learn how to use the tools and information Wall Street  professionals use.   *** Learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind.    It's time to ask yourself: ""Am I going to listen to the  Professionals who say BUY BUY BUY but never sell?  Or am I going to take control of my own financial future  and start making money RIGHT NOW in the stock market?""  Who is looking out for your best economic interests - some wealthy Wall Street stockbroker  or yourself?  With the Master Trader e-book  you will learn everything you  need to know in order to get started with Day Trading ... from  choosing the best broker in order to take advantage of the  lowest commissions and instant order executions to professional  trading strategies that make professional traders millions of  dollars.  The Master Trader e-book is the most comprehensive yet easy to  understand and straight-forward book ever written about active  trading. If you are serious about success in short term stock  trading - ORDER TODAY and start paving the road to your own financial future.  Oh  and remember that scraggly kid in the eighth grade? His high school friends laughed when he said he was going to  make money in the stock market.    Six years later  he bought a beach-front home on the California coast - WITH CASH.  Oops  they weren't laughing anymore.  In a rollercoaster market like we have today  day trading is the fastest track to wealth.  If you're looking for a long-term retirement investment with no risk  that goes up 5% a year  then by all means  this ain't your kind of game.  But if you want the QUICKEST possible way to make a FORTUNE in the market  with the lowest element of risk  then order the MASTER TRADER e-book right now.

I was just a tall  goofy looking kid in middle school with buck-teeth and freckles.  Each day in the cafeteria  I walked from table to table ...  Stealing other kids' lunch money.  No  I didn't rob them with a gun or a knife - I just made them a little deal.  ""Let me borrow two dollars today "" I said  ""and I'll bring you five dollars next week.""  The investment was too good to pass up  and other kids were throwing their lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes.  Of course  when ""next week"" rolled around and I couldn't pony up the cash  I promised to pay them even more the week after that  if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit  longer.  Eventually the end of the year came and went  high school started and with it came girls  and homework  and parties  and sports  and those poor kids from eighth grade had more  things on their mind than last year's lunch money.  I made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid  and I didn't even get beat up.  Hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market  secrets you will ever learn.  First of all  greed is your number one enemy. You're not going to turn $2 into $5 in a week  so cash out when you're ahead.  Don't wait for the boat to sink before  grabbing the lifejacket.  Second  never trust an investment adviser of any kind. They are looking out for their own money  not yours.  The ""professionals""  those stuffy investment counselors and money managers  will always tell you that the best time to buy is NOW.  According to those guys  the longer you keep your money in the market  the more money you're going to make. Ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is ""NEVER"".    In a sense  they are right.  If you put $250 000 in an index fund right now  you'll probably have over a million dollars in thirty or forty years.  But here's the problem:  Do you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich?  Hell no!  You want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It's hard to make use of your fortune when you're seventy years old  in a wheelchair.  If you could make a million dollars in the next few years  what would you do with it?  Where would you travel?  What kind of car would you buy?    The fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich.  If your goal is to make quick profits in the market  volatility is your ally  and stability your enemy.  You want to see those large upswings  two hundred points in a day  followed by the four hundred point crash a week later.  You don't care if the market went up or down 20% this year as long it was UNSTABLE.  That's how you're going to make the  money.  What I'm talking about here is day trading.    My father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks  and he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years  he makes money.   The day trader buys or sells 5 000 shares of XYZ for a $25 000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade.  He acts quickly  taking  advantage of all the information at his disposal about a  certain stock  and estimating whether it will go up or  down within hours  sometimes within minutes.    I can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing  amounts of money at it.  It's not rocket science  and you  only need to learn a few basic principles to get started.  Society would have you believe that successful trading is  complicated and requires formal training.    The truth is  wealthy people use very simple investment  strategies to make money.    Popular media and investment professionals portray successful trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing ring.  They don't want the competetion - and they sure as hell don't want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm to execute a trade for which they'd charge you forty or fifty  dollars.  They make their money only if you believe two lies:  1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average  person.  2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high  commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks  per trade.  Here is what the financial gurus in today's society absolutely  positively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ...  The strategies for profitable day trading are in fact so simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend a few hours of studying.    After reading over 200 financial books and publications during the past decade  and after using day trading to successfully make more than four million dollars in the stock market  I've learned the following lessons:  ** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple.  ** Anyone can do it.  ** It only takes a few hours to learn.  When I discovered the secret to day trading  I didn't become wealthy overnight.  If you want instant cash  drive to Wal-mart.  Buy a ski mask and a shotgun  and rob your local bank. The  only way to get rich  quick or otherwise  is through hard work  knowledge  and determination.  After learning the fundamentals of day trading  I started  practicing the trading art itself  and the first few weeks brought modest gains.  The next few months gave me the practical experience I needed to really earn a living  and I was pulling close to a six figure income. In less than three years with no  formal financial training  minimal effort and only moderate risk  I had made my first million.  The knowledge that I gained  during those formative trading years I am willing to share with you in my new book  the Master Trader.  You will learn from my mistakes  and from my successes  as I teach you the simple  secret formula for day trading that I've used profitably year after year.  The income of the day trader can be staggering.  Thousands  even  hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within minutes.  The difference between making money and losing your  shirt is simply this: knowledge.  I will provide that knowledge  and I will give you a winning edge at this high-stakes game.   Average Income of a Day Trader:  5% average an income in excess of $500 000 per year 22% average an income in excess of $250 000 per year 35% average an income in excess of $100 000 per year.  27% average an income between $50 000 and $99 999 per year  11% average an income between $20 000 and $49 999 per year   After reading the Master Trader  you will discover extremely  profitable  simple yet powerful trading methods that give  you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you  win DESPITE the current market weakness.   Here is just a snippet of what I will teach you:  *** Make money whether a stock goes up or down.   *** Learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds.   *** Learn exactly what stocks to trade  the exact price to  buy them and the exact price to sell them.    *** Save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the  mistakes beginners make.   *** Learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money  consistently in every market!    *** Learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance  for great success.    *** Profit on huge intraday price swings.   *** Make money on the biggest news stories.   *** Actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum returns.    *** Learn how to use the tools and information Wall Street  professionals use.   *** Learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind.    It's time to ask yourself: ""Am I going to listen to the  Professionals who say BUY BUY BUY but never sell?  Or am I going to take control of my own financial future  and start making money RIGHT NOW in the stock market?""  Who is looking out for your best economic interests - some wealthy Wall Street stockbroker  or yourself?  With the Master Trader e-book  you will learn everything you  need to know in order to get started with Day Trading ... from  choosing the best broker in order to take advantage of the  lowest commissions and instant order executions to professional  trading strategies that make professional traders millions of  dollars.

His high school friends laughed when he said he was going to  make money in the stock market.    Six years later  he bought a beach-front home on the California coast - WITH CASH.  Oops  they weren't laughing anymore.  In a rollercoaster market like we have today  day trading is the fastest track to wealth.

I am sorry this mail Will surprise you  though we do not know  my mother Mrs. Clara  Got your contact through her private search. Due to the current war against white farmers in Zimbabwe and the support of President Robert Mugabe to Claim all white owned farms in our country to gain Favor for re-election.  All white farmers were asked to Surrender their farms to the government for Re-distribution and infact to his political party Members and my father though black was the treasury of the farmers association and a strong member of an Opposition party that did not support the president Idea. He then ordered his party members and the police Under his pay row to invade my father's farm and burn Down everything in the farm. They killed my Father and took away a lot of items from his farm. After the death of my father  our local pastor and a Close friend of my father handed us over will Documents with instructions from my father that we Should leave Zimbabwe incase anything happen to him. The will  Documents has a certificate of deposit  confirming a deposit Kept in custody for us in a security company unknown To the company that the content is money hence it was deposited as  Personal belongings and ensure that we do not remain here as we could Easily be found by his enemies. The total amount is US$21.5M.We are therefore soliciting for Your assistance to help us move the fund out of Zimbabwe  as our fate and future is far from reality  hence this mail to you. The president's present ban of International Press into Zimbabwe and the drop from office of the  Finance Minister to avoid giving white farmers fund Transfer Clearance above US$1M is just a few of the Unthinkable things he is committing in my Country. I have tried to reach my father's close friend Mr. John Casahans from Australia also a farmer who was Leaving in Zimbabwe with us but left with his family Late last year following this ugly development to no Avail. Should you be interested to help us  contact me Immediately via email for easy communication and I Will furnish you with the time frame and modalities of the transaction. We have concluded a wonderful plan of  Caring out the transfer within two weeks. Please note that  This transaction is100% confidential and risk free and will  Not endanger you or us in any way. We have resolved to give you 20% Of the total sum upon confirmation of the fund in any Account of your choice were the incident of taxation will not take much tool on the money and we look Forward to coming over to your country to invest our Share and settle there.

It works exactly the same   but you don't get the manual and box and the price is only $19.99.That is a  saving of $280  and the only difference is you don't have a colorful box and  manual - which are not very  useful.

We help individuals unlock cash from unutilized assets.  Individuals usually age 65 or older who find that their health  financial and/or estate planning needs have changed are typical candidates. We have had some candidates advised by financial planners to drop their life insurance policies so they could invest their money in a vehicle that will make them a return now. DO NOT drop your policy as it may be worth CASH to you NOW.  Why do people sell their policies?  The reasons individuals make the decision to sell their life insurance policies are as varied as the people themselves. Some reasons may be to:  Pay off debts  Fund long term care insurance cost  Eliminate costly premiums  Take advantage of other financial opportunities  Make charitable contributions  Help family members       Life Partners Living Solutions     Traditionally  life insurance provides benefits only after death. With Life Partners  it can provide cash benefits for LIFE!     Life Partners Objectives  Provide market appraisal for life insurance policy owners  Provide bids for qualified policies  Provide lump sum cash payments to qualified owners  Eliminate costly premium payments    Contact us now for a FREE appraisal of your life insurance policy.

Venture Reporter 307 West 36th Street  10th Floor New York  New York 10018 Phoe: 646.473.2222 The online content business.                                Dear Friends     The online content business is doing fantastic.      Sound crazy? Perhaps.  With  advertising  online and off   taking it on the chin for the past two years   online content sites have been shutting down   laying off staff and pulling back on their offerings.      However   this horrible environment has resulted in an undeniable trend:  content businesses are challenging people to pay for content.  Finally   after five years of free   people are beginning to understand that online   as in the real world   you get what you pay for and they are taking out their credit cards.  U.S.  consumers spent $675 million&nbsp;on paid&nbsp;online content last year   a 92 percent increase over 2000 spending levels   according to Online Publishers Association   and that figure is expected to increase exponentially this year.  Look at these success stories:                     New York Times Digital has  been steadily increasing its paid content services over the last year   and  registered a 16 percent increase in its total revenues for the latest quarter.                  TheStreet.com brought over  $3 million in subscriptions last quarter   an increase of almost 50 percent  over the year-ago quarter.                  ConsumerReports.com will  reach over a million paying subscribers by the end of this year.                  RealNetworks' consumer multi-media  subscription service has more than 750 000 subscribers   bringing in $17.8  million in the last quarter.                  The Wall Street Journal Online added over 6 000 new paying customers last quarter   bringing its subscriber base to 646 000.                  FT.com has signed up 17 000  subscribers in three months since it launched its premium site in May.            In recognition of this trend we're hosting  the third installation of our innovative Content Management Summit on October 10   2002.  The event charts the changes in the content industry from free  to paid subscription services   and the technologies that are enabling the management and monetizing of content.      Our previous Content Management  Summit (aka Digital Rights Summit) on October 18 last year in New York City  and January 29 in Los Angeles were unqualified successes.      The Content Management Summit  III   taking place in New York at the Millennium Broadway on October 10   2002   will bring together the 100 executives from the leading content and  distribution firms for a focused day of networking and discovering practical  solutions.      The event will feature presentations  from software and services companies providing services and solutions for selling   distributing   managing   and protecting content.      We're thrilled that  Microsoft   TeleKnowledge   eMeta   and Liquify will all be demonstrating  their latest products and services.      The event will also feature six intimate round tables focusing on various aspects of online content.  These panels are meant to provide an informal forum to discuss the challenges facing these specific vertical markets   the changes in the sectors since the dot-com downfall   and best practices in the industry.  The panels will feature leading practitioners in each sector   and will also include an interactive question and answer session with the audience.      Among the round table topics will be:                     Weblogs:  how they are affecting big media  companies   editorially as well as in content delivery/production mechanisms.                  Financial news and information  companies:  how they are using technologies to deliver content to users   and how the economics have changed since the stock market downfall.                  Business information services  such as Hoovers   Lexis-Nexis and others:  best practices in the industry    niche product launches and revenue streams.                  Daily news/newspaper companies  publishing online:  how speed dictates technology choices   and the move towards paid content and its implications   among other issues.                  Consumer and entertainment  publishers:  how do publishers determine the value of entertainment content    the push towards paid subscriptions   online advertising and other issues.            Join us on October 10th  for this very important event.  If you are directly responsible  for content management at a major content site you may qualify for  a VIP ticket.

My Dear    Good day.This very confidential request should come as a surprise to you.But it is because of the nature of what is happening to me and my family urged me to contact you  and I quite understand that this is not the best way to contact you because of the nature of my request and the attention it requires.I got your contact information from your country's information directory during my desperate search for someone who can assist me secretly and confidentially in relocating and managing some family fortunes.  My name is Mr.Michael Kamah  the second son of Mr.Smith  Kamah  of Beitbridge Zimbabwe.At the height of the present political crises in our country in which the white farmers in our country are being slained and ripped off their belongings by the supporters of our president Mr.Robert G.Mugabe in their efforts to reclaim all the white owned farms in our country my father and my elder brother were brutally slained to a painful death on the 13th of february 2002  in their struggle to protect some white farmers who ran to take refuge in our house.My father during his life on earth was a prominent business man who trades on diamond and gold from some foreign countries .He publicly opposes the crude policies and crime against humanity on the white farmers by Mr.Robert Mugabe and his followers which they enforced media law restrictions to protect their wicked acts.That not being enough the president and his followers after winning the last undemocratic elections decided to block and ! confiscate all accounts and assets of our black indigenes[that included my fathers assets and accounts] who oppose his policies and render support to these white farmers along with the assets of these white farmers themselves that are being presently confiscated.I therefore decided to move my mother and younger sister to the Republic of South Africa where we presently live without anything and without any source of livelyhood.  During my fathers life on earth he had deposited the sum of Eight Million and Six Hundred Thousand United States Dollars[$8.600.000.00] in a trunk box with a Finance and Security Company in the Republic of Togo for a cash and carry Diamond and Gold business with some foreign business customers  awaiting instructions to be moved to its destination which he never completed before he met his untimely death on that faithful day.In view of this and as the only surviving son of my father and with the present clamp down killing and confiscation of his assets as one of those who render support to the white farmers in our country I therefore humbly wish to inform you of my intentions to use your name and adress in making sure that this fund is lifted out of Africa finally to the Europe office of the finance company and also seek for your honest and trustworthy assistance to help me clear and accommodate this money over there before it is dictated out and blocked by the present Mugabe's!  regime.My mother is presently with the valid document covering this deposit.  Now this is what I actually want you to do for me;  1. I want you to be presented to the Finance and Security company as the person I contacted to assist my family for this purpose  with whose name and adress myself and my mother will forward to them their office in the Republic of Togo as the person that will clear this money when they lift it out to their europe office. 2. To finally assist me in accommodating and managing this money in any lucrative business in your country for at least three years.   Please I hope you will grant and view this very request with favour and much understanding of our situation now and will be a very honest and reliable person to deal with.And also bearing in mind the confidential nature of this my request I emphasize please that you keep every bit of it to yourself so as to protect my familys future and yourself rendering this help.Thanking you in anticipation of your urgent response as soon as you read this very request.

The sum of USD48M (Forty eight Million United States) was  lodged into a security company here in the Country by the  late Head of State (GEN.SANI ABACHA) for safe-keeping. This  money was lodged in security vaults / boxes and labelled as personal belongings and as such the security company does  not know the true content of the boxes.This money was  originally meant to be used for his political campaign.  Because I was his family Attorney as such he confided in me  with the relevant document papers relating to this deposit  before he died of cardiac arrest.  As a matter of fact we have concluded all arrangement with  an offshore Security Company to move this money as a  consignment through diplomatic means to their offshore  affiliated office where you will be required to put claim  to the consignment as the bonafide beneficiary of the  consignment. You should know that this business is safety  and 100% risk-free as it does not involve drug money or  Terrorist fund.   If you are interested to carry out this transaction with  me  20% will be for you for your assistance  5% for general  expenses  and 75% for us.  You are required to send by e-mail immediately your Full  name and Address  which I will use to draft an agreement  that will guide and protect both of us in this transaction  also which will be used to effect the change of ownership  of the consignment to your name as the beneficiary of the  consignment.

What is ""Ghetto""  America  I'm glad you asked. Before I go on please be warned   this explanation may not sit well with many of you  however it is  no less true! ""Ghetto"" America is a society of individuals  comprised primarily of African Americans who represent the  impoverished  and often unpolished side of ""Black America;""  Confused?! I shall explain further; have you ever passed by a  typical ghetto community; namely the ""projects"" and noticed an  unusual amount of fancy cars parked throughout that particular  neighborhood  and wondered how could that be? Or maybe you have  been to a shopping mall  and noticed an unusual amount of young  ""teen looking"" black women carrying infants  or pushing baby  carriages and often with a toddler in tow! Perhaps you also  noticed that there was rarely any male companion accompanying  them. If you paid close attention you might have also noticed the  absence of the all important ""wedding band"" missing from their  respective ring fingers!"" .And of course we have all heard  stories of young black men carrying guns  and knives  allegedly  mugging  robbing and carjacking people of all sorts! Did you know  that many young African American women refuse to date African  American males if they do not own or possess an automobile. In  fact many young Black women prefer only to date individuals who  represent the subversive side of society; commonly known as  ""Thugs"" or ""Street Hustlers;"" Also  did you know that many young  African American males prefer to buy expensive luxury cars while  living in government housing better known as the ""projects""  rather than move away  purchase new homes  save  or even make  investments?       ""Attention"" This is Not another ""Boyz in the Hood"" Story!   These newly distinguished ""Black Generation Xers"" are suffering  through utter chaos. ""Baby Makers  Loser choosers  Welfare  Abusers...Images of My America"" is a collection of observations   and commentary as told through the eyes of a young African  American Male who experienced  and perpetuated many of the truths  that many in ""Black America "" and the world in general would have  you believe do not exist. It is a riveting expose that sheds  light on the oppressive  and often discriminatory nature of  ""Mainstream American Society."" A society that has nurtured the  rampant disregards for self-respect  and enlightenment that many  young African American men  and women currently suffer from. The  writer supports his arguments with direct references to the  overwhelming numbers of young black single mothers attempting to  raise children  with many being teens themselves; and the foolish  criteria that is utilized when choosing their mates; oftentimes  being based on nothing more than the young black male's tough or  cool neighborhood reputation.   The author also identifies the self-destructive and often  criminal behavior that many young black men perpetuate on a daily  basis like  refusing to pursue higher education  carrying guns   robbing  stealing  selling drugs  driving fancy cars  and wearing  expensive jewelry. The negative and self-debasing behavior  committed by both males  and females is due in large part to a  lack of guidance resulting from having been reared in fatherless  homes. These poor choices  and behavioral disorders coupled with  the unnecessary burden that it places on tax paying citizens in  the form of welfare abuse  and over crowded prison populations  are the center causes for the cycle of rampant poverty  and lack  of direction that currently exists in young ""Black America""  today.

Socijalisti koji za sebe danas kazu da vise nisu idolopoklonici Slobodana Milosevica  neprestano  u kontaktima sa clanovima i simpatizerima te partije  pokusavaju da razdvoje odbranu Slobodana Milosevica u Hagu  od politickog zivota u Srbiji  pripisujuci Milosevicevim braniocima iz nacionalnog komiteta za oslobadjanje S. Milosevica    Sloboda'' da im je cilj da uniste Socijalisticku partiju Srbije.         Iako je zbog istih takvih gledista  svojevremeno najpolularniji socijalista  posle predsednika te stranke  prof. Branislav Ivkovic bio iskljucen iz redova SPS  danas rukovodstvo SPS koristi jos teze i grublje kvalifikacije na racun njihovog predsednika  pritom ne strahujuci da bi bilo ko od njih mogao biti iskljucen iz partije.         Ne retko se poslednjih dana  u rokovodstvu partije cuje da partija nije Slobodan Milosevic  i da on ne predstvalja tu partiju  vec da su partija Rukovodstvo i Glavni odbor te stranke.         Medjutim u clanstvu i medju simpatizerima te stranke  stvari se ne odijaju bas po planovima rukovodstva.         Procene idu dotle da se na septembarskim izborima ocekuje da Bata Zivojinovic osvoji tek 1% glasova.  Clanovi partije  najveci deo njih i danas veruje svom heroju  Slobodanu Milosevicu.         Po clanstvu partije  ovih dana u rukovodstvu partije  oni koji su predsednika te stranke pogresno informisali poslednjih godina  kada su shvatili da im je   odzvonilo'' pokusavaju da sacuvaju sebe eliminacijom predsednika Slobodana Milosevica.         Mladi socijalisti  kojih i nema bas mnogo  kako se SPS svojevremeno hvalio  izgleda su na strani predsednika te stranke. Tako se u nastupima na opstinskim odborima  mogu cuti uverljivi govori Dejana Stjepanovica i Igora Raicevica  i po neki Milinka Isakovica iz redova mladih socijalista  clanova organizaciono politickog odbora predsednika SPS.          Obracanja ovih mladih ljudi  medju clanstvom partije imaju do deset puta vecu tezuni  nego li obracanja profesionalnih politicara koji za sobom vuku teret proslosti.          Stav rukovodstva mladih socijalista  se razlikuje od stava saveta mladih  koji su takodje na strani predsednika.           Branko Ruzic i Dejan Backovic  svojevremeno najveci branioci i zastupnici lika i dela Slobodana Milosevica  danas su se pretvorili u njegove najvece kriticare. Pokusavaju na sve moguce nacine da minorizuju grupu mladih koja ga podrzava.          Cak se poslednjih dana cuje  da je najbolji recept da se rukovodstvo mladih odrzi ikao je protiv Sloba  da se povezu rodbinskim vezama  pa se tako predsednik mladih socijalista Beograda  Ana Djurovic udala za Branka Ruzica  predsednika Mladih socijalista Srbije  koji je za kuma uzeo Dejna Backovia  svog potpredsednika. Backovic se ovih dana zeni  jednom  mladom socijalistkinjom koja je clan saveta mladih  a u isto vreme i sestra jednog od clanova IO GO SPS-a  za kuma uzima jos jednog mladog socijalistu iz Saveta mladih. Sve u svemu  mladi u SPS se drze kao italijanske mafijaske porodice 60-tih u SAD.           Sta ce se do kraja price dogoditi ostaje pitanje  no clanstvo i simpatizeri ce oceniti rad svog rukovodstva na predsednickim izborima.           Pimato se samo  sta ce da rade  ako im Bata prodje losije od Seselja koga je predsednik Slobodan Milosevic podrzao za predsednickog kandidat?        _______________________________________________________________________ Powered by List Builder To unsubscribe follow the link: http://lb.bcentral.com/ex/sp?c=15279&s=90B245569C3B981A&m=4",1

I have become aware that there is no formal distinction separating young African?Americans from the general definition of ""Generation X"". Aside from it being regarded as the generation that followed ""Baby Boomers""  it's important to point out there is no root definition for this term as well. Since the theme of this work is centered on identifying the realities and misconceptions of young African?American culture  I have chosen a definition that incorporates all of the components that were part of my birth  childhood  and young adult life. Taken from a web site entitled ""Generation X""  created and maintained by the Colorado College  the definition is as follows:     ""We are a group of people born between 1961 and 1981. We are individuals who live for the 'here and now'  like to experiment  and who require immediate results. We are typically selfish  and cynical  and depend a lot on our parents. We question authority  and feel like we carry the burden of the previous generations. It's that simple. It seems we have come to be called ""Xer's"" simply because we represent something negative to our elders. We may be the one thing all of the generations that precede us have in common  that is the ability to speak assuredly about our shortcomings. Of course  they overlook the fact that we are their responsibility  or actually their fault. Our generation will be called upon to look after our parents knowing they failed to look after us. Intergenerational justice failed somewhere along the way and it will be our task to either rectify it or make it worse."" ""We are a group of individuals who grew up with no one at home after school. It appears we have little hope for the future. No jobs  no homes  and basically no money are almost expected of us. These bleak prospects  along with the fact that we will be forced to support the largest amount of senior citizens ever  do not provide much hope. Some believe that these blockades will be too much for us to handle and we will for the most part fail at life  but many see our individualism and resourcefulness that has been built up through our childhood  as our saviors. We will soon discover who is right and who is wrong.""   This definition is important because it demonstrates the widely held belief that Generation X is comprised of one core group of American citizens. It over generalizes the similarities it expresses  and applies them to all those who were born within the corresponding years. When in fact these ""similarities"" speak primarily to only ""white"" issues and concerns. For instance  ""they"" say ""we"" depend a lot on our parents  but in ghetto America ""we"" could only depend on one our mothers! ""They"" also say  "" . . .we feel like we carry the burden of previous generations "" and "" . . . we will be forced to support the largest amount of senior citizens ever."" In ghetto America  no one ever gives these issues any thought because survival is in the here and now  and is all ""we"" have time for.  I have known for many years that the differences that separate Generation Xer's black and white occupants would eventually be identified. I never knew I would be the one doing it. Extracting the ""Black"" from ""Generation X"" and categorizing it for its own sake is a necessary and important contingency. Without doing so  the social ills that plague Ghetto America would be lost within the generalities that are explained away as part of a collective American identity. There are many hidden truths that exist in black America today. ""White America"" charges that we spend our time collecting welfare  refusing to vote  reading elementary styled books  watching music videos  day dreaming of becoming rappers  basketball players  selling drugs  and making babies. Much of this is supported in Marlon Riggs's documentary entitled ""Ethnic Notions."" When African Americans are mentioned  whites typically envision an image that is strikingly similar to the one that graces the cover of this book. A reality that I confirmed while watching ""Roger & Me "" another documentary written  and directed by Michael Moore. Sadly  many of us have begun to validate this skewed image  while others bend over backwards in an attempt to pretend we do nothing of the kind  only to be contradicted and embarrassed when presented with the daily programming line up for B.E.T. (Black Entertainment Television). Many of us fail to realize  that whatever embarrassment or shame the ex  posed truth may reveal  should be taken as an opportunity to improve  empower  enlighten  and ultimately change anyone who is guilty of perpetrating this kind of behavior. Regarding Black Women: I have known many in my life and although each has had unique attitudes and personalities  I began to notice the majority of them shared the same collective mentality toward black men as a whole-that black men owed them something  and are required to provide and fulfill what was missing from their lives  be it emotional  physical  or economical.  Normally that type of assertion would not warrant opposition from me  so long as a reciprocal attitude was extended. In most cases  it has not been. It's funny though  looking back  I am surprised I never paid any attention to the beliefs and attitudes that different black women subscribe to  or the various schools of thought they possessed. Many have placed strict demands and presumptions on the African?American male  some fair and some unfair. Much of what the public believes and understands about the black female's social structure is often filtered by others in the black community who believe these inaccurate and frequently positive representations will somehow change the reality that is.  What originally sparked my attention was an observation I stumbled upon while skimming through and reading books related to black male and female interaction. I noticed virtually all of the books I read in the genre depict an inaccurate and misleading concentration on the affluent African?American perspective. These stories and commentaries tend to suggest that all African?Americans thrive on a middle?to?upper class professional level. They relay stories of relationship problems with ""Huxtable?like"" bachelors and bachelorettes whose only concern is why the other has not confessed his or her love. As I read these stories I couldn't help but become irritated by the blatant omission of the prevailing majority of blue collar or ""working class"" African?Americans. Although there are those in the black community that can identify with the ""Huxtable?like"" dynamic  unfortunately  they are few and far between.  The majority of stories I have read seem to be geared toward fantasizing and romanticizing the oppressive state of affairs that have plagued Black America. The black authors who have written these books fear the potential backlash awaiting anyone who would dare air out our ""dirty laundry"". The fact is  truth should never be stifled by fear of any kind.  I recently had a candid conversation with some very dear female friends who stated that although they fully acknowledge the terrible state of affairs many of our women are currently drowning in  they felt that publicizing their predicament would be viewed as a form of betrayal. As our discussion intensified  I reminded them that the only way change can be effected is by increasing public awareness that change is needed  and oftentimes  not exposing the truth can be more crippling than the truth itself.  The purpose of my book is in essence an attempt to change the self?destructive thinking and self?imprisoning behavior that ""black male and female generation X"" have been subscribing to. While discussing this with my friend  she suggested I simplify my writing style so my potential black readers could better understand what I'm attempting to convey. Acknowledging the real possibility of my message being misunderstood  I suggest to those readers that if they want to fully appreciate the finer points of this narrative-to grab a dictionary. (Don't feel bad-there were several times I had to as well!) Regarding Black Men: An overwhelming number of us have become preoccupied with being cool  buying sports wear  driving expensive cars  wearing gold or platinum jewelry  and often without legitimate personal wealth and while living under the most deplorable conditions! I have chosen to address this rarely acknowledged side of African?American culture because I have lived it. I have seen the chaos and futility that exists on this level. It is a world of ignorance  selfishness  pre?occupation  and idiocy. In my world there are people who applaud a lack of education  who brag about having served time in U.S. penitentiaries  the types of guns they carry  dope peddling  and chasing women. They champion the notion of having children without any regard to the poor environment many of them currently inhabit. In this world  wearing expensive clothes and carrying fancy handbags is mandatory even if it means spending their last dollar in order to look like they've got a million. It's a world where children dress in over?priced sports wear  mimicking and idolizing whatever popular athlete or rapper is currently in the public eye.  Thinking  such as the belief that fancy clothes are what define one's self?worth  and the possible corruption this thinking breeds  seems to not be an important concern for black mothers. It may come as a shock to know that most African?Americans feel that those who don't have the same  if not better  material possessions  are lesser beings  referring to them as being corny  lame  or broke. Even our ""male rapper"" entertainers promote backward priorities-nothing else matters as long as you look good. ""The Big Tymers""  a popular rap duo  have a song called ""I'm Still Fly""  shown in heavy rotation on B.E.T. and played regularly on black radio stations throughout the country. (""Fly"" is ghetto vernacular for well dressed  also used to describe a female's beauty). Its signature verse asserts:  ""I got gator boots with a pimped out Gucci Suit  can't pay my rent cause all my money's spent  but that's O.K. cause I'm still fly.""  Worse yet  in the song ""Grinding""  the popular duo ""Eclipse"" glorifies the selling of illegal drugs in inner city neighborhoods as children play and dance throughout the entire video. (The term ""grinding"" is ghetto vernacular for the selling of illegal drugs) The fact that this song and video is also shown in heavy rotation on B.E.T. is further evidence that our world is in utter turmoil. Some of the key lyrics to this song are ""grindingyou know what I keep in the lining"" (the area in their coats where they hide illegal drugs) and  ""Patty cake Patty cake I'm the bakers man I bake them cakes as fast as I can and you can tell cause of how my bread stack up and I disguise it as rap so the feds backup""  In this verse  the group refers to the process of cooking cocaine and its transformation into cocaine base or crack. When created it is compressed into the form of a large cookie with the average diameter being the size of a typical cake. (hence the term ""cake"" or sometimes ""pie"") Unfortunately for the rap genre  this song seems to strengthen the long standing argument posed by most whites that rap music is nothing more than an entertainment medium catering to violent drug offenders  who want and do nothing more than carry guns and break the law.  The negative references I've identified have become an integral part of the urban African?American existence. This mutated reality is ridiculous and unacceptable. This ideology should not be permitted to continue any longer than it already has. There is an overwhelming part of the African?American community that is aware of this crippling mentality. There are also many that are unaware and unfortunately  more that do not even care. Those of us who are in the know have a responsibility to educate and enlighten those of us who are not aware of the negative behavior being perpetrated daily. Whether because of habit or misguided values  this type of ideology is cyclical and thrives off of ignorance. It should be apparent to us all that we cannot wait for some other race to come and save us. We must save ourselves! I am well aware that many of you are probably furious by now  and are thinking  what right do I have to express the opinions I have thus far  as well as those I have al  luded too.  I have chosen to chronicle my experiences because of the diversity and seriousness of their content. There is far too much negativity thriving within our culture. There must be acknowledgment and accountability for the truth  whether good or bad. I am aware that not all of ""us"" have succumbed to the crippling mentality that is rampant in our community  and I have chosen to concentrate on individuals who have had a profound impact on my life. Any similarities and generalizations I illustrate are directed solely toward individuals in the black community who share the collective negative thinking and behavior that will hereafter be identified.  Additionally  throughout this book I will refer to African?Americans in four different ways; the first being ""African?Americans""  denoting our status as citizens in the United States; secondly  as ""Black""  a reference that identifies and defines our differences and struggles in this country; third  as ""Niggas "" a term which is often misunderstood and should not be confused with ""Nigger"". The term ""nigga"" has become an accepted form of reference among young black males used to express friendship (hence the term ""My Nigga"") as well as a blanket reference when speaking to  of  or about other black males in a non?personal manner. I felt it necessary to make this distinction because many of the experiences I will refer to mandate the use of the term to effectively communicate the attitude and mood that existed during the time each story took place; and fourth  as ""Ghetto""  this term is largely intended as an internal reference commonly understood by blacks as a means to define the   less polished members of our community.  It is important to note that the use of either term has no negative connotation and is therefore not to be associated with any feeling as such.  My commentary is based on real?life situations  both good and bad  and how one African?American man was affected by them. To that end  I feel it is necessary to acknowledge that my intention is not to condemn the individuals I have encountered. Despite the negativity they have displayed  I only want to make them aware that the selfish and self debasing attitudes they subscribed to  in many ways  has caused them to become their own worst enemy. In the case of the black female's negative and limited perspective toward black men  the world  and subconsciously themselves  I submit that this mentality is perhaps single?handedly responsible for the lack of success  happiness  and quality of life that is at the center of every African?American woman's fantasy quest. It is also important to note that the selfish and negative attitudes at the core of the tension that exists between black women and men  has been deliberately created by ""White America"". For example  much of the existing resentment between black women and men can be traced as far back as slavery on up to present day. Many past issues have taken on new identities and have re?emerged in the form of corporate acceptance of black women and the corporate exclusion of black men. The resulting economic independence that some black women now enjoy has caused them to challenge and judge the black man for his absence within corporate America  without realizing and ackno  wledging that this absence is by design.  There are other ""core"" issues that have been passed down and nurtured from generation to generation  such as color barriers  light skin versus dark skin  good hair versus bad hair  loyalty  devotion  and economic status. Believe it or not  there was once a time when black women refused to date a black man if he didn't sell drugs or was not ""thugged out"". (a term for being rough or hoodlum-like) The reasoning behind it being that the ""thug "" and ""drug dealer"" lifestyle was synonymous with financial independence.  These issues  among others  relate directly to the confused mentality that exists within our internal society. Sadly that ""confused mentality"" is responsible for much of the neglect the African American ""ghetto"" community receives at the hands of our more affluent brethren. Who have locked it away in the basement  and seems to be more concerned with convincing the rest of the world that ""ghetto America does not exist. Furthermore  the lack of acknowledgement of which I speak should not be confused with the impoverished masses of the African American community.  Their plight is a well-known reality  but in many cases much of ghetto America falls under that same umbrella. Be advised: this book is not a colorful or lighthearted look into ""Black America"".  Rather it should be viewed as a legitimate tool for identifying and changing the backward thinking that so many young African Americans (including myself) have come to perpetuate. Moreover  that ""backward thinking"" is the main   cause of our inability to strive for a common goal. An outcome that must be met; and can only be met  with Godly faith  positive strategy  cooperation  love  loyalty  self and mutual respect. *************************************************************  To read More go to www.blackrealitypublishing.com   To Unsubscribe: send mail to majordomo@FreeBSD.org with ""unsubscribe freebsd-ports"" in the body of the message",1

Socijalisti koji za sebe danas kazu da vise nisu idolopoklonici Slobodana Milosevica  neprestano  u kontaktima sa clanovima i simpatizerima te partije  pokusavaju da razdvoje odbranu Slobodana Milosevica u Hagu  od politickog zivota u Srbiji  pripisujuci Milosevicevim braniocima iz nacionalnog komiteta za oslobadjanje S. Milosevica    Sloboda'' da im je cilj da uniste Socijalisticku partiju Srbije.         Iako je zbog istih takvih gledista  svojevremeno najpolularniji socijalista  posle predsednika te stranke  prof. Branislav Ivkovic bio iskljucen iz redova SPS  danas rukovodstvo SPS koristi jos teze i grublje kvalifikacije na racun njihovog predsednika  pritom ne strahujuci da bi bilo ko od njih mogao biti iskljucen iz partije.         Ne retko se poslednjih dana  u rokovodstvu partije cuje da partija nije Slobodan Milosevic  i da on ne predstvalja tu partiju  vec da su partija Rukovodstvo i Glavni odbor te stranke.         Medjutim u clanstvu i medju simpatizerima te stranke  stvari se ne odijaju bas po planovima rukovodstva.         Procene idu dotle da se na septembarskim izborima ocekuje da Bata Zivojinovic osvoji tek 1% glasova.  Clanovi partije  najveci deo njih i danas veruje svom heroju  Slobodanu Milosevicu.         Po clanstvu partije  ovih dana u rukovodstvu partije  oni koji su predsednika te stranke pogresno informisali poslednjih godina  kada su shvatili da im je   odzvonilo'' pokusavaju da sacuvaju sebe eliminacijom predsednika Slobodana Milosevica.         Mladi socijalisti  kojih i nema bas mnogo  kako se SPS svojevremeno hvalio  izgleda su na strani predsednika te stranke. Tako se u nastupima na opstinskim odborima  mogu cuti uverljivi govori Dejana Stjepanovica i Igora Raicevica  i po neki Milinka Isakovica iz redova mladih socijalista  clanova organizaciono politickog odbora predsednika SPS.          Obracanja ovih mladih ljudi  medju clanstvom partije imaju do deset puta vecu tezuni  nego li obracanja profesionalnih politicara koji za sobom vuku teret proslosti.          Stav rukovodstva mladih socijalista  se razlikuje od stava saveta mladih  koji su takodje na strani predsednika.           Branko Ruzic i Dejan Backovic  svojevremeno najveci branioci i zastupnici lika i dela Slobodana Milosevica  danas su se pretvorili u njegove najvece kriticare. Pokusavaju na sve moguce nacine da minorizuju grupu mladih koja ga podrzava.          Cak se poslednjih dana cuje  da je najbolji recept da se rukovodstvo mladih odrzi ikao je protiv Sloba  da se povezu rodbinskim vezama  pa se tako predsednik mladih socijalista Beograda  Ana Djurovic udala za Branka Ruzica  predsednika Mladih socijalista Srbije  koji je za kuma uzeo Dejna Backovia  svog potpredsednika. Backovic se ovih dana zeni  jednom  mladom socijalistkinjom koja je clan saveta mladih  a u isto vreme i sestra jednog od clanova IO GO SPS-a  za kuma uzima jos jednog mladog socijalistu iz Saveta mladih. Sve u svemu  mladi u SPS se drze kao italijanske mafijaske porodice 60-tih u SAD.           Sta ce se do kraja price dogoditi ostaje pitanje  no clanstvo i simpatizeri ce oceniti rad svog rukovodstva na predsednickim izborima.           Pimato se samo  sta ce da rade  ako im Bata prodje losije od Seselja koga je predsednik Slobodan Milosevic podrzao za predsednickog kandidat?        _______________________________________________________________________ Powered by List Builder To unsubscribe follow the link: http://lb.bcentral.com/ex/sp?c=15279&s=54EE057E0B6864FB&m=5",1

I'm looking for investment properties in the Midwest. The issue I've been having is that not every everyone deals with the properties I'm looking for. You know the houses that you are almost sure will not sell; maybe they're really ugly or need a lot of work or are in a bad neighborhood. But for what ever reason  the houses just don't sell.  I need those houses...  Most of the agents I've dealt with were hesitant because there isn't much of a return for what time and effort you invest. However  the private investors I work with use ""unconventional"" private funding so we both can avoid long drawn out loan approvals. In fact most cases we just pay cash and close in a week. I am pre-qualified with Greentree Funding for up to $900 000 for a purchase money mortgage based on a non-owner occupied loan at 90% LTV.  (And of course you get your full commission.)   I'm not a licensed real estate agent nor am I affiliated with any real estate firm  which means I can work with you just about any way you want. Please don't be under the impression that we have to pay under market value to be interested. Sometimes I can even pay retail price. The only guarantee I'll make is that I will not waste your time  and in most cases I can tell you over the phone whether I'm interested or not.   If you are looking to purchace a project home from our inventory or would like information on forming an alliance with  Synteligent Properties  please contact me @ 847.366.4300 or email me @ jeremy@synteligent.com   Best Wishes   Jeremy Lessaris   847.366.4300 www.synteligent.com jeremy@synteligent.com   To Unsubscribe: send mail to majordomo@FreeBSD.org with ""unsubscribe freebsd-ports"" in the body of the message",1

MICHAEL BUNDU""  Subject: [ILUG] ASSISTANCE Sender: ilug-admin@linux.ie Errors-To: ilug-admin@linux.ie X-Mailman-Version: 1.1 Precedence: bulk List-Id: Irish Linux Users' Group  X-Beenthere: ilug@linux.ie Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit  FROM: COL. MICHAEL BUNDU.  DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO.  Tel No: Your country Intl. access code +8821652098236 email : mikebundu@rediffmail.com Dear Sir/Madam   SEEKING YOUR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE.   Please permit me to make your acquaintance in so informal a manner. This is necessitated by my urgent need to reach a  dependable and trust worthy foreign partner. This request may seem strange and unsolicited but I crave your indulgence  and pray that you view it seriously. My name is COL. MICHAEL BUNDU of the Democratic Republic of Congo and one of  the close aides to the former President of the Democratic Republic of Congo LAURENT KABILA of blessed memory  may  his soul rest in peace.   Due to the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA to force out the rebels in my country  I and some of my colleagues were  instructed by Late President Kabila to go abroad to purchase arms and ammunition worth of Twenty Million  Five Hundred  Thousand United States Dollars only (US$20 500 000.00) to fight the rebel group. We were then given this money privately  by the then President  LAURENT KABILA  without the knowledge of other Cabinet Members. But when President Kabila  was killed in a bloody shoot-out by one of his bodyguards a day before we were schedule to travel out of Congo  We  immediately decided to put the funds into a private security company here in Congo for safe keeping. The security of the  said amount is presently being threatened here following the arrest and seizure of properties of Col. Rasheidi Karesava  (One of the aides to Laurent Kabila) a tribesman  and some other Military Personnel from our same tribe  by the new  President of the Democratic Republic of Congo  the son of late President Laurent Kabila  Joseph Kabila.   In view of this  we need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who can assist us to move this money out of my country  as the beneficiary.  WE have sufficient ''CONTACTS'' here to move the fund under Diplomatic Cover to a security company in Europe in your  name. This is to ensure that the Diplomatic Baggage is marked ''CONFIDENTIAL'' and it  will not pass through normal custom/airport screening and clearance.   Our inability to move this money out of Congo all this while stems from our lack of trust of our supposed good friends  (western countries) who suddenly became hostile to those of us who worked with the late President Kabila  immediately  after his son took office. Though we have neither seen nor met each other  the information We gathered from an associate  who has worked in your country has encouraged and convinced us that with your sincere assistance  this transaction will  be properly handled with modesty and honesty to a huge success within two weeks. The said money is a state fund and  therefore requires a total confidentiality.   We would please need you to stand on our behalf as the beneficiary of this fund in Europe. This is because we are under  restricted movement and watch and hence we want to be very careful in order not to lose this fund which we have worked  so hard for. Thus  if you are willing to assist us to move this fund out of Congo  you can contact me through my email  addresses  Tel/Fax nos. above with your telephone  fax number and personal information to enable us discuss the  modalities and what will be your share (percentage) for assisting us.  Please note that There are no RISKS involved in this Deal as everyone's Security is Guaranteed if we follow the required  guidelines. I will hence furnish you with further details of this Deal as soon as I am assured of your Sincere interest to assist  us.   I must use this opportunity and medium to implore you to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily  confidential  Whatever your decision  while I await your prompt response. Thank you and God Bless.  Best Regards    COL. MICHAEL BUNDU(RTD). m_bundu@rediffmail.com  N\B.

"Date: Thu  19 Sep 2002 02:14:46 +1000 X-Mailer: eGroups Message Poster  Hello  You may have seen this business before and ignored it. I know I did - many times! However  please take a few moments to read this letter. I was amazed when the profit potential of this business finally sunk in... and it works!  With easy-to-use e-mail tools and opt-in e-mail  success in this business is now fast  easy and well within the capabilities of ordinary people who know little about internet marketing. And the earnings potential is truly staggering!  I'll make you a promise. READ THIS E-MAIL TO THE END! - follow what it says to the letter - and you will not worry whether a RECESSION is coming or not  who is President  or whether you keep your current job or not. Yes  I know what you are thinking. I never responded to one of these before either. One day though  something just said: ""You throw away $25.00 going to a movie for 2 hours with your wife. What the heck."" Believe me  no matter where you believe those ""feelings"" come from  I thank every day that I had that feeling.   I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be doing had I not. Read on. It's true. Every word of it. It is legal. I checked. Simply because you are buying and selling something of value.  AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV:  Making over half a million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your home.  THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET! ================================================== BE AN INTERNET MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!!  Before you say ""Bull""  please read the following. This is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the internet  a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below  to see if it really can make people money. The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal.  Their findings proved once and for all that there are ""absolutely NO laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can 'follow the simple instructions' they are bound to make some mega bucks with only $25 out of pocket cost"".  DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED  IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER.  This is what one had to say: ""Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I was approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment  I received a total $610 470.00 in 21 weeks  with money still coming in.""  Pam Hedland  Fort Lee  New Jersey. ================================================== Another said: ""This program has been around for a long time but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again in the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to come in. First month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made a total of $290 000.00. So far  in the past 8 months by re-entering the program  I have made over $710 000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change anything.""  More testimonials later but first  =======  ==== PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE ==== $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$  If you would like to make at least $500 000 every 4 to 5 months easily and comfortably  please read the following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN!!!  $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$  FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND  YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE  GUARANTEED!  INSTRUCTIONS:  =====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below =====  For each report  send $5 CASH  THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON  YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.  ===WHEN YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER  MAKE SURE === ===YOU ORDER EACH OF THE 5 REPORTS! === You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5 = $25.00.  Within a few days you will receive  via e-mail  each of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1 000's of people who will order them from you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case something happens to your computer.  IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report  or their sequence on the list  in any way other than what is instructed below in steps 1 through 6 or you will lose out on the majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this works  you will also see how it will not work if you change it.   Remember  this method has been tested  and if you alter it  it will NOT work!!! People have tried to put their friends'/relatives' names on all five thinking they could get all the money. But it does not work this way. Believe us  some have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not try to change anything other than what is instructed. Because if you do  it will not work for you. Remember  honesty reaps the reward!!!   This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You are offering a product for sale and getting paid for it. Treat it as such and you will be VERY profitable in a short period of time.  1.. After you have ordered all 5 reports  take this advertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # 5. This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.  2.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.  3.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.  4.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.  5.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2  6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.  PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY! This is critical to YOUR success.  ================================================== **** Take this entire letter  with the modified list of names  and save it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.  Save this on a disk as well just in case you lose any data. To assist you with marketing your business on the internet  the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally  where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more. There are 2 primary methods to get this venture going:  METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY ==================================================  Let's say that you decide to start small  just to see how it goes  and we will assume you and those involved send out only 5 000 e-mails each. Let's also assume that the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much better but let's just say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only 5 000 each.  Continuing with this example  you send out only 5 000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response  that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded by sending out 5 000 e-mails each for a total of 50 000. Out of those 50 000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's 100 people who responded and ordered Report # 2.  Those 100 people mail out 5 000 e-mails each for a total of 500 000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.  Those 1000 people send 5 000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response is 10 000 orders for Report # 4.  Those 10 000 people send out 5 000 e-mails each for a total of 50 000 000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100 000 orders for Report # 5.  THAT'S 100 000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500 000.00 (half a million dollars).  Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3.....$5 000 + 4..... $50 000 + 5.... $500 000 .... Grand Total=$555 550.00  NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT  YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY! ==================================================  REMEMBER FRIEND  THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5 000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100 000 e-mails each or more?  There are over 150 million people on the internet worldwide and counting  with thousands more coming online every day. Believe me  many people will do just that  and more!  METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET ==================================================  Advertising on the net is very  very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive  all you must do is e-mail them the report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day service on all orders.  This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out  with your name and address on it  will be prompt because they cannot advertise until they receive the report.  ===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ==================== The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is illegal or somehow ""wrong"". It is simply about time. Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved  etc. Concealing it is simply so no one can SEE there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you.  ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of paper  write the NUMBER & the NAME of the report you are ordering  YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address.  PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW : ==================================================   REPORT # 1: ""The Insider's Guide To Advertising for Free On The Net""  Order Report #: 1 from Rui Sousa Santos P.O. Box 132 Taylors Lakes VIC  3038 Australia  ______________________________________________________  REPORT # 2: ""The Insider's Guide To Sending Bulk Email On The Net""  Order Report # 2 from:  Richard Moulton P.O. Box 82 Hot Springs MT 59845 USA  ___________________________________________________  REPORT # 3: ""Secret To Multilevel Marketing On The Net""  Order Report # 3 from:  J.siden krondikesvgen 54 A 83147 stersund Sweden  _____________________________________________________  REPORT # 4: ""How To Become A Millionaire Using MLM & The Net""  Order Report # 4 from:  Francis Kidd P.O. Box 209 Homestead PA 15120 USA  __________________________________________________  REPORT # 5: ""How To Send Out One Million Emails For Free""  Order Report # 5 From:  M.J. Lee P.O. Box 19 52 Victoria Drive London SW19 6BD United Kingdom ______________________________________________________ $$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$  Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:  === If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 2 weeks  continue sending e-mails until you do.  === After you have received 10 orders  2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for REPORT # 2. If you do not  continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do.  ** Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report # 2  YOU CAN RELAX  because the system is already working for you  and the cash will continue to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your name is moved down on the list  you are placed in front of a different report.  You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate from this business !!! ================================================= FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM:  You have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life  with NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can make more money in the next few weeks and months than you have ever imagined. Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way. It works exceedingly well as it is now.  Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your name and address in Report #1 and moved others to #2 .....# 5 as instructed above. One of the people you send this to may send out 100 000 or more e-mails and your name will be on every one of them.   Remember though  the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach. So my friend  I have given you the ideas  information  materials and opportunity to become financially independent.  IT IS UP TO YOU NOW !  =============MORE TESTIMONIALS=============== ""My name is Mitchell. My wife  Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving 'junk mail'. I made fun of the whole thing  spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of her  and was ready to lay the old 'I told you so' on her when the thing didn't work.   Well  the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she had received total $ 147 200.00 ......... all cash! I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her 'hobby'.""  Mitchell Wolf M.D.  Chicago  Illinois ================================================ ""Not being the gambling type  it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan. But conservative as I am  I decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back. I was surprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with orders. I made $319 210.00 in the first 12 weeks.   The nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return and so big.""  Dan Sondstrom  Alberta  Canada ================================================= ""I had received this program before. I deleted it  but later I wondered if I should have given it a try. Of course  I had no idea who to contact to get another copy  so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone else......... 11 months passed then it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one! I made more than $490 000 on my first try and all the money came within 22 weeks.""  Susan De Suza  New York  N.Y. ================================================= ""It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with little cost to you. I followed the simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the money started to come in. My first month I made $20  in the 2nd month I made $560.00 and by the end of the third month my total cash count was $362 840.00. Life is beautiful  Thanx to internet.""

"Date: Thu  19 Sep 2002 01:15:03 +1100 MIME-Version: 1.0 Content-Type: text/plain; charset=""iso-8859-1"" X-Priority: 3 (Normal) X-Msmail-Priority: Normal X-Mailer: Microsoft Outlook  Build 10.0.2627 Importance: Normal Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit  Hi   I'm a college dropout.  I work about two hours a day.   I'm ambitious  but extremely lazy  and I make over  $250 000 a year.  Are you curious yet?  In a minute I'm going to tell you my secret  it's the dirty little secret of the Internet ...  You've probably heard stories about people making whopping huge money online  but you thought they  were the big corporate execs  famous programmers  or boy-geniuses.  Well  grasshopper  think again ...  It's people like you and me that are making the real money.  Yep  people like YOU AND ME!  Ever since the ""dot com bubble"" burst in 1999  small-time entrepreneurs are getting richer while the Fortune 500  companies look for bankruptcy lawyers.  Today small business owners and ordinary folks  like you and me can use the web to achieve complete  financial freedom with NO INVESTMENT and very little  work.  How?  By learning the most profitable marketing  technique ever created - it's called BULK EMAIL.  If you've ever recieved an email advertisement  then  you know what bulk email is.  I bet you can't click on  DELETE fast enough for most of those ads  right? You might not want their product  but remember that  thousands of other folks probably do.  Bulk email is a  percentage game - every bulker who contacts you  makes a six figure income on the Internet.  I  guarantee it.  Now let's go back to Math 101 and  review some numbers ...  If you sell on eBay  you pay anywhere from a few dollars to over a hundred dollars just to post one auction.  How many people see your ad?  Maybe a couple thousand or even ten or twenty thousand over a period of days.  Using bulk email  YOU CAN SEND YOUR AD TO MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE A DAY at virtually no cost.  Whether your send 100 000 emails or 100 million emails  the price is the same. ZERO!  Stop paying those outrageous auction listing fees when hardly anyone sees your ad!  Imagine that you have a decent product with a  profit margin of $20.00 on each sale.  If you send  an email ad to 500 000 people  and only one person  in a thousand actually places an order  then you just  generated 500 orders and made $10 000 in a few hours  of work.    It's that simple ...  All you have to do is convince ONE PERSON OUT OF A THOUSAND to buy your stuff and you're FILTHY RICH.  The best thing is that anyone can do it.  Doesn't  matter if you're a nineteen-year-old college student  using a dorm-room computer or a fifty-year-old  executive working from an office building in New  York City.  Anyone  and I repeat ANYONE  can start  bulk emailing with virtually no startup costs.  All  it takes is a  few days of study  plenty of ambition   and some basic familiarity with the Internet.  I quit college when I was 19 to capitalize on the  ""Dot Com"" mania  and I've never looked back.  I  started with no money  no product to sell  and only  the most rudimentary computer skills.  I saw an  opportunity and I seized it.  A few years later   I bought my own home - with CASH.    You don't need any money.  You don't need a product. You don't need to be a computer nerd and no experience whatsoever is required.    If you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like that you'd jump right on it.  It would be a dream come true. So what are you waiting for?!  I'm going to ask you four simple questions.  If you answer YES to all of them  then I can almost promise that you will make at least $100 000 using bulk email this year.  Here goes ...  Do you have basic experience with the web?  Do you have a computer and an Internet connection? Do you have a few hours each day of free time?   Do you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards  complete financial freedom?    If you answer YES to these questions  you could be making $5 000 - $20 000 per week working from your  home.  Kiss your day job goodbye - this sure beats  the 9-5 daily grind!  All you need is ambition and commitment.  This is no ""get rich quick scheme"".  You have to work to make big bucks  but ANYONE - and I mean ANYONE - can do  it.  You're probably wondering if it's hard to get started.   Don't worry  it's not! I will show you step-by-step  how to start your first email campaign and how to build a booming online business.  You'll be generating  orders - AND MAKING MONEY - in less than seven days.  Okay  so what if you don't have anything to sell?  No problem!!  I'll show you where to find hot products that sell like CRAAAAAAZY! Most people delay starting an Internet business because they have  nothing to sell  but I'm removing that hurdle right now.   After reading the Bulkbook  you can build your complete  product line in less than two hours!  There is NO EXCUSE  not to get started! I will get you up-and-running within  seven days. In fact ...  I personally guarantee that you will start your own  bulk email campaign less than a week after reading  the Bulkbook!

This seperate guide contains a daily  routine for you to follow with specific  exact  instructions on how to get started.  On day one  for  example  I teach you where to find a product to sell.  The next day you learn how to build a fresh mailing  list.  On the seventh day  you just click send!  Your  very first campaign is ready to go.

When you know it  it rests deep in your bones  and it's hard not to get overly excited and scream it to the world  which is why I'm writing you today. Although this program is launching with all the potential of being as big as anything on the Internet  and you will soon see it advertised and promoted everywhere you go  I would like to give you an opportunity to get in early before the masses. Traditionally  there have been a couple of flaws to any MLM (multi-level marketing for you newcomers) that have made it difficult for programs to last after the initial hoopla. Today  we have launched the solution to those problems  the newest and most innovative system ever to hit Multi-level Marketing. With a new software system and an ingenious payplan  combined with a 100% payout  everyone comes out a winner.    The truth is  you've got to see it to believe it  so rather than feed you a lot of hype and tell you this is the miracle you've been looking for  the magic link that will end all your problems  or a lot of other things you don't need to hear  I'm just going to make you a very simple offer. Email me with 'Send Link' in the subject line to:  itshappening@mail2world.com  and I will provide the link so you can take a test drive  absolutely risk-free. You can get a birds-eye inside look  revealing the inner-workings of this revolutionary new discovery in online income opportunities. Should you decide you like what you see  you will have the option of activating your position  but that is completely at your option. This isn't a trick  I'm just so convinced that this is such a sound program and unique but solid opportunity that I don't want you to miss out on the chance to get an early position. With an explosive launch  positions will be filling up rapidly  and you have before you a chance to explore the program before diving in head first. If you're one of those cautious people (and who isn't these days on the Internet)  that likes to ""look before you leap"" then here is your chance. Thank you for your time  and I hope you discover why we're all smiling!!   Please do not treat this message as spam. I am a professional and very successful networker with a data base of 100 000. I was pursueded to purchase this list containing 200 000 names of individuals  which is guaranteed to include only those people who have given their consent to receive information. I have not used this means of marketing before and frankly I am dubious about its validity. However  having spent an arm and a leg purchasing it I'm initially sending this message to just a small number of the email address's (2 000) to guage results. If you want more information I will happily supply the link without any obligation. But if its of no interest or you take exception to receiving this mail then please accept my apologies for the intrusion and delete the message immediately.

To assist you with marketing your business on the internet  the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally  where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more. There are 2 primary methods to get this venture going:  METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY ==================================================  Let's say that you decide to start small  just to see how it goes  and we will assume you and those involved send out only 5 000 e-mails each. Let's also assume that the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much better but let's just say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only 5 000 each.  Continuing with this example  you send out only 5 000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response  that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded by sending out 5 000 e-mails each for a total of 50 000. Out of those 50 000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's 100 people who responded and ordered Report # 2.  Those 100 people mail out 5 000 e-mails each for a total of 500 000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.  Those 1000 people send 5 000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response is 10 000 orders for Report # 4.  Those 10 000 people send out 5 000 e-mails each for a total of 50 000 000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100 000 orders for Report # 5.  THAT'S 100 000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500 000.00 (half a million dollars).  Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3.....$5 000 + 4..... $50 000 + 5.... $500 000 .... Grand Total=$555 550.00  NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT  YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY! ==================================================  REMEMBER FRIEND  THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5 000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100 000 e-mails each or more?  There are over 150 million people on the internet worldwide and counting  with thousands more coming online every day. Believe me  many people will do just that  and more!  METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET ==================================================  Advertising on the net is very  very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive  all you must do is e-mail them the report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day service on all orders.  This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out  with your name and address on it  will be prompt because they cannot advertise until they receive the report.  ===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ==================== The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is illegal or somehow ""wrong"". It is simply about time. Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved  etc. Concealing it is simply so no one can SEE there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you.  ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of paper  write the NUMBER & the NAME of the report you are ordering  YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address.

You can make more money in the next few weeks and months than you have ever imagined. Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way. It works exceedingly well as it is now.  Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your name and address in Report #1 and moved others to #2 .....# 5 as instructed above. One of the people you send this to may send out 100 000 or more e-mails and your name will be on every one of them.   Remember though  the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach. So my friend  I have given you the ideas  information  materials and opportunity to become financially independent.  IT IS UP TO YOU NOW !  =============MORE TESTIMONIALS=============== ""My name is Mitchell. My wife  Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving 'junk mail'. I made fun of the whole thing  spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of her  and was ready to lay the old 'I told you so' on her when the thing didn't work.   Well  the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she had received total $ 147 200.00 ......... all cash! I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her 'hobby'.""  Mitchell Wolf M.D.  Chicago  Illinois ================================================ ""Not being the gambling type  it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan. But conservative as I am  I decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back. I was surprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with orders. I made $319 210.00 in the first 12 weeks.   The nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return and so big.""  Dan Sondstrom  Alberta  Canada ================================================= ""I had received this program before. I deleted it  but later I wondered if I should have given it a try. Of course  I had no idea who to contact to get another copy  so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone else......... 11 months passed then it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one! I made more than $490 000 on my first try and all the money came within 22 weeks.""  Susan De Suza  New York  N.Y. ================================================= ""It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with little cost to you. I followed the simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the money started to come in. My first month I made $20  in the 2nd month I made $560.00 and by the end of the third month my total cash count was $362 840.00. Life is beautiful  Thanx to internet.""

IT IS UP TO YOU NOW !  =============MORE TESTIMONIALS=============== ""My name is Mitchell. My wife  Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving 'junk mail'. I made fun of the whole thing  spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of her  and was ready to lay the old 'I told you so' on her when the thing didn't work.   Well  the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she had received total $ 147 200.00 ......... all cash! I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her 'hobby'.""  Mitchell Wolf M.D.  Chicago  Illinois ================================================ ""Not being the gambling type  it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan. But conservative as I am  I decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back. I was surprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with orders. I made $319 210.00 in the first 12 weeks.   The nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return and so big.""  Dan Sondstrom  Alberta  Canada ================================================= ""I had received this program before. I deleted it  but later I wondered if I should have given it a try. Of course  I had no idea who to contact to get another copy  so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone else......... 11 months passed then it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one! I made more than $490 000 on my first try and all the money came within 22 weeks.""  Susan De Suza  New York  N.Y. ================================================= ""It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with little cost to you. I followed the simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the money started to come in. My first month I made $20  in the 2nd month I made $560.00 and by the end of the third month my total cash count was $362 840.00. Life is beautiful  Thanx to internet.""

I work about two hours a day.   I'm ambitious  but extremely lazy  and I make over  $250 000 a year.  Are you curious yet?  In a minute I'm going to tell you my secret  it's the dirty little secret of the Internet ...  You've probably heard stories about people making whopping huge money online  but you thought they  were the big corporate execs  famous programmers  or boy-geniuses.  Well  grasshopper  think again ...  It's people like you and me that are making the real money.  Yep  people like YOU AND ME!  Ever since the ""dot com bubble"" burst in 1999  small-time entrepreneurs are getting richer while the Fortune 500  companies look for bankruptcy lawyers.  Today small business owners and ordinary folks  like you and me can use the web to achieve complete  financial freedom with NO INVESTMENT and very little  work.  How?  By learning the most profitable marketing  technique ever created - it's called BULK EMAIL.  If you've ever recieved an email advertisement  then  you know what bulk email is.  I bet you can't click on  DELETE fast enough for most of those ads  right? You might not want their product  but remember that  thousands of other folks probably do.  Bulk email is a  percentage game - every bulker who contacts you  makes a six figure income on the Internet.  I  guarantee it.  Now let's go back to Math 101 and  review some numbers ...  If you sell on eBay  you pay anywhere from a few dollars to over a hundred dollars just to post one auction.  How many people see your ad?  Maybe a couple thousand or even ten or twenty thousand over a period of days.  Using bulk email  YOU CAN SEND YOUR AD TO MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE A DAY at virtually no cost.  Whether your send 100 000 emails or 100 million emails  the price is the same. ZERO!  Stop paying those outrageous auction listing fees when hardly anyone sees your ad!  Imagine that you have a decent product with a  profit margin of $20.00 on each sale.  If you send  an email ad to 500 000 people  and only one person  in a thousand actually places an order  then you just  generated 500 orders and made $10 000 in a few hours  of work.    It's that simple ...  All you have to do is convince ONE PERSON OUT OF A THOUSAND to buy your stuff and you're FILTHY RICH.  The best thing is that anyone can do it.  Doesn't  matter if you're a nineteen-year-old college student  using a dorm-room computer or a fifty-year-old  executive working from an office building in New  York City.  Anyone  and I repeat ANYONE  can start  bulk emailing with virtually no startup costs.  All  it takes is a  few days of study  plenty of ambition   and some basic familiarity with the Internet.  I quit college when I was 19 to capitalize on the  ""Dot Com"" mania  and I've never looked back.  I  started with no money  no product to sell  and only  the most rudimentary computer skills.  I saw an  opportunity and I seized it.  A few years later   I bought my own home - with CASH.    You don't need any money.  You don't need a product. You don't need to be a computer nerd and no experience whatsoever is required.    If you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like that you'd jump right on it.  It would be a dream come true. So what are you waiting for?!  I'm going to ask you four simple questions.  If you answer YES to all of them  then I can almost promise that you will make at least $100 000 using bulk email this year.  Here goes ...  Do you have basic experience with the web?  Do you have a computer and an Internet connection? Do you have a few hours each day of free time?   Do you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards  complete financial freedom?    If you answer YES to these questions  you could be making $5 000 - $20 000 per week working from your  home.  Kiss your day job goodbye - this sure beats  the 9-5 daily grind!  All you need is ambition and commitment.  This is no ""get rich quick scheme"".  You have to work to make big bucks  but ANYONE - and I mean ANYONE - can do  it.  You're probably wondering if it's hard to get started.   Don't worry  it's not! I will show you step-by-step  how to start your first email campaign and how to build a booming online business.  You'll be generating  orders - AND MAKING MONEY - in less than seven days.  Okay  so what if you don't have anything to sell?  No problem!!  I'll show you where to find hot products that sell like CRAAAAAAZY! Most people delay starting an Internet business because they have  nothing to sell  but I'm removing that hurdle right now.   After reading the Bulkbook  you can build your complete  product line in less than two hours!  There is NO EXCUSE  not to get started! I will get you up-and-running within  seven days. In fact ...  I personally guarantee that you will start your own  bulk email campaign less than a week after reading  the Bulkbook!  I'll give you a toll-free phone number  to reach me 24 hours a day  seven days a week;  where else will you find that level of service?!

This seperate guide contains a daily  routine for you to follow with specific  exact  instructions on how to get started.  On day one  for  example  I teach you where to find a product to sell.  The next day you learn how to build a fresh mailing  list.  On the seventh day  you just click send!  Your  very first campaign is ready to go.  As a special bonus  you'll recieve a FREE copy  of our STEALTH MASS MAILER  a very powerful bulk  email program which retails for $49.99!

Most of these emails are from people who are NOT making any money. And they expect you to listen to them?  Enough.  If you want to make money with your computer  then you should hook up with a group that is actually DOING it.  We are making a large  continuing income every month.  What's more - we will show YOU how to do the same thing.  This business is done completely by internet and email  and you can even join for free to check it out first.  If you can send an email  you can do this.  No special ""skills"" are required.  How much are we making?  Anywhere from $2000 to $9000 per month. We are real people  and most of us work at this business part-time. But keep in mind  we do WORK at it - I am not going to  insult your intelligence by saying you can sign up  do no work  and rake in the cash.  That kind of job does not exist.  But if you are willing to put in 10-12 hours per week  this might be just the thing you are looking for.  This is not income that is determined by luck  or work that is done FOR you - it is all based on your effort.  But  as I said  there are no special skills required.  And this income is RESIDUAL - meaning that it continues each month (and it tends to increase each month also).  Interested?  I invite you to find out more.  You can get in as a free member  at no cost  and no obligation to continue if you decide it is not for you.  We are just looking for people who still have that ""burning desire"" to find an opportunity that will reward them incredibly well  if they work at it.  To grab a FREE ID# and have more information  simply go to the   web address http://club.4tfox.com  and send me an email with following   informtion  ""Send me a free membership!""  Be sure to include your: 1. First name 2. Last name 3. Email address (if different from above)  We will confirm your position and send you a special report as soon as possible  and also Your free Member Number.  If you are not interested in tring to Earn Money   :) you are interested in the huge discount from the 140 Online Shops  Very Cheap ISP package and many many more   You can also go to the web address: http://club.4tfox.com/#id-GreatService  That's all there's to it.  We'll then send you info  and you can make up your own mind.  Looking forward to hearing from you!  Sincerely    Hugh Zou  P.S. After having several negative experiences with network marketing companies I had pretty much given up on them. This is different - there is value  integrity  and a REAL opportunity to have your own home-based business... and finally make real money on the internet.  Don't pass this up..you can sign up and test-drive the program for FREE.  All you need to do is get your free membership.

Most of these emails are from people who are NOT making any money. And they expect you to listen to them?  Enough.  If you want to make money with your computer  then you should hook up with a group that is actually DOING it.  We are making a large  continuing income every month.  What's more - we will show YOU how to do the same thing.  This business is done completely by internet and email  and you can even join for free to check it out first.  If you can send an email  you can do this.  No special ""skills"" are required.  How much are we making?  Anywhere from $2000 to $9000 per month. We are real people  and most of us work at this business part-time. But keep in mind  we do WORK at it - I am not going to  insult your intelligence by saying you can sign up  do no work  and rake in the cash.  That kind of job does not exist.  But if you are willing to put in 10-12 hours per week  this might be just the thing you are looking for.  This is not income that is determined by luck  or work that is done FOR you - it is all based on your effort.  But  as I said  there are no special skills required.  And this income is RESIDUAL - meaning that it continues each month (and it tends to increase each month also).  Interested?  I invite you to find out more.  You can get in as a free member  at no cost  and no obligation to continue if you decide it is not for you.  We are just looking for people who still have that ""burning desire"" to find an opportunity that will reward them incredibly well  if they work at it.  To grab a FREE ID# and have more information  simply go to the   web address http://club.4tfox.com  and send me an email with following   information  ""Send me a free membership!""  Be sure to include your: 1. First name 2. Last name 3. Email address (if different from above)  We will confirm your position and send you a special report as soon as possible  and also Your free Member Number.  If you are not interested in tring to Earn Money   :) you are interested in the huge discount from the 140 Online Shops  Very Cheap ISP package and many many more   You can also go to the web address: http://club.4tfox.com/#id-GreatService  That's all there's to it.  We'll then send you info  and you can make up your own mind.  Looking forward to hearing from you!  Sincerely    Hugh Zou  P.S. After having several negative experiences with network marketing companies I had pretty much given up on them. This is different - there is value  integrity  and a REAL opportunity to have your own home-based business... and finally make real money on the internet.  Don't pass this up..you can sign up and test-drive the program for FREE.  All you need to do is get your free membership.

"Date: Thu  26 Sep 2002 04:22:43 +0200 Subject: BUSINESS PARTNERSHIP(URGENT/CONFIDENTIAL) X-Mailer: Microsoft Outlook Express 5.00.2919.6900 DM MIME-Version: 1.0 Content-Type: text/plain; charset=""us-ascii"" X-MIME-Autoconverted: from quoted-printable to 8bit by dogma.slashnull.org     id g8PFMQC01001 Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit  Mr.Vincent Nnaji   Standard Trust Bank Ltd   Lagos Nigeria.  Dear Sir   I am Mr.Vincent Nnaji  Bank Manager of Standard Trust Bank Lagos Nigeria. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.  On January 6 1998 a Foreign Oil Consultant Foreign contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation Mr. James Herbert made a numbered time Fixed Deposit for twelve calendar months valued at US$20M ( Twenty Million United States Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. James Herbert died from an automobile accident.  On further investigation  I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.James Herbert did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$20M has carefully been moved out of my bank to a security company for safe-keeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it.  According to Nigerian Law at the expiration of 5 years the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money I deposited it in a security company in two trunk boxes though the security company does not know the contents of the boxes as I tagged them to be photographic materials for export I am writing you because I as a public servant I cannot operate a foreign account or have an account that is more than $1m.  I want to present you as the owner of the boxes in the security company so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. All these are to make sure that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials.  This is simple. I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the owner of the boxes. The money will be shared in the ratio of 70% for me and 25% for you and 5% will take care of all expenses.  There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantee the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested  please reply immediately via my private email address.  Upon your response I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe with utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.  Awaiting your urgent reply via my private email to indicate your interest.  Thanks and Regards   MR.VINCENT NNAJI.",1
Date: Wed  25 Sep 2002 16:46:33 -0700 Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit  Dear Sir   With due respect and humility I write you this letter which I believe you would be of great assistance to my children and I. I got your contact through my husband commercial address book and believed that you must be a trust worthy and reliable person that will not like to intimidate me or betray my trust after hearing this news. I am a native of KONOBO in the KEREMA local district of SIERRA LEONE in West Africa and the wife of Late DR. MUNDI A. KOJO who was assassinated by the rebel forced loyal to Major John Paul Koromah because he was the Director General National Gold and Diamond Mining Corporation of Sierra Leone. Few days before my husband was assassinated  he  instructed me and my children (Ibrahim and Amina) to move out of Sierra Leone immediately  before the powerful Economic community of West African States (ECOMOG) forces intervened  which eventually resulted into a brutal civil war. My children and I managed to escape to Togo through the help of my husband's friend. We came into Togo with some valuables including a cash sum of $25MILLION(TWENTY FIVE MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS ONLY) in two trunks boxes which I have deposited with a Trust Company here in Togo and special arrangement has been made with the currier company who will freight the money to your country. Meanwhile  I want to leave Togo entirely with this money for investment in your country because of a stable political situation there and mostly for the future of my children. I want you to please assist us to claim this fund from the Trust Company in any of their branches in Europe  after which the fund will be deposited into your account for investment in your country. You should also help us to source for good investment opportunity so that we can invest wisely in your country when the fund is finally confirmed in your account. We have it in mind to reward you handsomely for your assistance as we have resolved to give you 20% of the total sum for your help. But due to how I am being monitored by the Sierra Leonean Government Secret Agents  I will advice you to have the  deal concluded with my son (IBRAHIM KOJO). Please contact my son on this email: ibrahimkojo@caramail.com   immediately you receive this letter to enable us proceed in earnest towards retrieving the consignments and transferring same into your account. Your private Fax and Phone is needed in this transaction for private discussions.  Note: There is no risk involved in this business.  Remain Blessed   MRS. ANNE  KOJO,1

I have decided to contact you with greatest delight and personal respect.  Well  I am  VICTOR SANKOH  Son to Mr.FODAY SANKOH who was arrested by the ECOMOG PEACE KEEPING FORCE months ago in my country Sierra Leone. Few days before the arrest of my father  he confided in me and ordered me to go to his underground safe and move out immediately  with a Deposit Agreement and Cash Receipt he made with a security Company in Abidjan Cote d'Ivoire where he deposited One Iron Box containing USD$ 22 million dollars cash (Twenty Two Million dollars).  This money was made from the sell of Gold and Diamond by my FATHER and he have already decided to use this money for future investment of the family before his arrest.  Thereafter  I rushed down to Abidjan with these documents and confirmed the deposit of the box by my father. Also  I have been granted political stay as a Refugee by the Government of Cte d'Ivoire.  Meanwhile  my father have instructed me to look for a trusted foreigner who can assist me to move out this money from Cte d'Ivoire immediately for investment . Based on this   I solicit for your assistance to transfer this fund into your Account  but I will demand for the following requirement:  (1) Could you provide for me a safe Bank Account where this fund will be transferred to in your country or another neaarby country where taxation will not takegreat toll on the money?  (2) Could you be able to assist me to obtain my travelling papers after this transfer to enable me come over to meet you in your country for theinvestment of this money?  (3) Could you be able to introduce me to a profitable business venture that would not require much technical expertise in your country where part of this fund willbe invested?  Please  all these requirements are urgently needed as it will enable me to establish a stronger business relationship with you hence I will like you to be the general overseer of the investment thereafter. I am a Christian and I will please  want you to handle this transaction based on the trust I have established on you.  For your assistance in this transaction  I have decided to offer you 12% percent commission of the total amount at the end of this business. The security of this business is very important to me and as such  I would like you to keep this business very confidential. I shall be expecting your urgent reply. Thank you and God bless you.

Actions & indications: Simultaneous  High-Spirited; ""Stimulation / Relaxation / Aphrodisia"" (Significant Paradise Consequence!)  This is the Personal Choice  Sensitive  Responsive Smoking (""Smoka"") product we have wanting to offer! This is the product and the VALUE that you have been searching for. This is the product that you will buy again & again!  We have been in the business (science) of developing non-cannabis  personal choice sensitive smoking agendas for a good  goodly while. Along this avenue of ethnobotany  we have always strived to achieve greater and greater ""Sensitivity / Responsiveness"" & Aphrodisia within our gourmet smokables and brews. And indeed  we have. Many of these previous products are still marketed today by companies who are less developmental than our botanical resource cooperative. Even our own two signature ""smokables"" (Ragga Dagga & Stoney Mahoney) are being discontinued. That Shangrila Zowie Wowie is by far such a superior product is undeniable  therefore it makes no sense to us at all to offer any other smoking product. Quite simply we have surpassed even our own expectations of excellence  thereby; our definition of excellence has evolved. This ""Shangrila"" project has been in research and development for sometime on two fronts. First  on an agricultural level  fields for our Gnarly SweetGrass!  must be planted and be allowed to propagate for several years before initial harvest can even be undertaken. This is how the botanical achieves ""potent significance"" much like the regimen of ginseng. Also  harvest time is limited and can take place only twice a year  as like the hemp plant  maximum potency is only achieved after ""flowering"" occurs. But  unlike the hemp plant  and for that matter  unlike most herbs  the entire base plant of Shangrila Zowie Wowie (leave  stem & root) is all ""viripotent "" which makes this ""gnarly stoke"" a botanical phenomenon! As well  most potentiating factors of Shangrila  as well as the primary botanical factor of Shangrila  will not achieve ""viripotency"" if grown in our hemisphere  therefore; Shangrila is indeed a multi-national  multi-complicated  agricultural undertaking. However  all of this undertaking has indeed been worthwhile! Secondly  the potentiating  infusion regimen used to enhance the attributes of Shangrila has also taken a lon! g time to bring into potent fruition as there are many balancings of the various molecular factors involved in the completion of Zowie Wowie. We are most pleased to be able to say  as you will note in the experience of Shangrila Zowie Wowie  that this process has achieved fruition.  Suffice to say  without any hype or glype  Shangrila Zowie Wowie Gnarly SweetGrass is without a doubt  the most significant  non-invasive  non-cannabis  ""sensitive/responsive""  personal choice  absolutely legal (cannot fail a drug test)  smoking (""Smoka"") botanical on our planet ... probably in the universe! Hard to believe that this product is ABSOLUTELY LEGAL!  * Mill-stoned & honed. * Depressive regressive! * Psychologically uplifting! * Good-bye stress  anxiety & restlessness! * Sophisticated  well-balanced ""ambiance."" * Inspires contemplativeness and creativity. * ""Potentiated"" & viripotent! * 4  5 draws lasts a good  goodly while. * Sweet aphrodisia! (Horny Goat Weed factoring) * Simultaneously; uplifting and relaxing! * Easy ignition  Smooth draw  Sweet  heady taste. * Easy on  easy off! * SATISFACTION GUARANTEED! * No ""munchie"" factor. * No failed drug tests!  Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) Gnarly ""SweetGrass"" botanical is best utilized as a viri-potent ""Smoka""  via an herb-pipe. As is an herbalist's way  four or five draws of ""Smoka"" should be inhaled and retained. For the non-smoker  it is most appropriate to engage this herbaceousness as a potentiated tea/brew. (Steep approximately one teaspoon of Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) herba per one cup of water for ten minutes or so & strain.) When smoking Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm)  please draw gently as it is a most preeminent ""Sensitive / Responsive"" Smoke. Both a personal water-pipe (huuka) (water-pipe is included with quarter pound can only) and a standard herb-pipe are included for your smoking convenience and delight. Smoke and Brew concurrently is absolutely a Sweet  Sensitive Treat!  Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) ""Sensitive/Responsive"" Smoka includes and is potentiated with the following non-irradiated  Mill-Stoned & Honed  exotica botanicals and botanical essences: Half-edged Lily-rare Bian Lian (lobeline factors)  Kona Lactuca virosa  Yucatan Turnera aphrodisaca  Hawaiian Vervain (Maui strain)  Siberian Leonorus Sibricus  rare Lotus Leaf  Jamaican Blue Verbena officinalis  Spanish Peumus Crocus Sativa  Chinese (flowering-tops only) Horny Goat Weed  Ginko Biloba  African Cola Vera  and African Wilde Dagga (flowering-tops only). Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) does not include any tobacco or any cannabis factors. Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) does indeed achieve gourmet distinction upon its own merit.  Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) is not intended for use during work or while driving. Nor should it be enjoyed during pregnancy. In addition  although no factor in Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) is illegal or regulated  it is the ethical policy of Exotic Botanical Resources that Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) not be sold or offered to any person that has not attained at least 21 years of age.

(See Intro Offers at bottom of this text for further savings)  ****************** **PROSAKA (tm)** ******************  High-Ratio extracts in tablet form for Calm  Balance  Serenity & Peaceful living.  This Prosaka formulation  which we have just recently further potentiated  boasts an extremely loyal and abundant patronage  having been available to market at large now for a number of years. Prosaka botanical tablets were originally introduced as a botanical  supplemental alternative to various traditional medications that are prescribed for stress  anxiety  depressiveness  mood enhancement  insomnia  excessive dream activity  etc. We like to use this analogy: Imagine the circumstances of your life to be hurricane-ish. Certainly  Prosaka will not stop the wind from blowing. However  it will help to center you within the calm eye of your hurricane  so that you will better see your living and make your decisions from a calmer  more serene  more balanced perspective. Please note that when undertaking any supplemental herbal regimen in this arena  it is important to make a personal commitment to the therapy. It would make no sense to purchase Prosaka and to take it only sporadic! ally or only briefly. It is for this reason  although Prosaka is a very expensive formulation to produce; that we offer 300 count containers at as much of a reduced price as we are able to offer.  Prosaka is an exclusive  proprietary amalgamation in tablet form which includes the following uncommon botanicals  extracts  flower-top essences and essential oils: Radix Salviae  Sensitive Mimosa Bark  Arillus Euphoriae  Shizandra  Frutcus Mori  Caulis Polygoni  Zizyohus  Tang Kuei  Cedar Seed  Sweetflag Rhizome  Cuscutae  Amber  Radix Scutellariae  Evodia  Longan  Arisaema  Cistanches  Radix Polygalae  Red Sage Root and Eucommia. No factor contained within Prosaka is restricted or regulated by law. All botanicals contained within are non-irradiated and are of pharmaceutical grade.   Suggested Usage: 1 - 2 tablets; 2 to 3 times per day as needed. Best taken on an empty stomach. (During times of intensity up to 10 tablets per day may be utilized.)   Also Note: Prosaka is not intended to supercede physician's care nor is it intended for use during pregnancy.  ******************************************************** PROSAKA PRICING:  * One 100 count bag ... $55.00 plus shipping * One 300 count container ... $130.00 plus shipping For larger quantities  please inquire.

Aqueous Kathmandu has only been offered to market at large for a short while. However  in a short time this product has achieved a tremendous  very happy following.  Aqueous Kathmandu (tm) ""Sensitive/Responsive"" Happiness Drops(Temple ""Quantum"" Variety). Indeed; a Happiness Brew from the Kathmandu a.k.a. ""Secret Fire"" from a toke-smoke point of view  if you know what I mean and be groovin' the scene. Who du the Kathmandu? Now  everybody can du the Kathmandu!  (that is  if you're 21 years of age or older) Aqueous Kathmandu is engaged to holistically inspire and instill ""sensitive/responsive"" happiness and mellowness without the detriment of carcinogenic inhalation (smoking). Aqueous Kathmandu is absolutely legal and does not contain any controlled  considered to be harmful or regulated herbs or cannabis/marijuana factors!  As ""smoking"" has become so socially taboo over the years and as so many people have asked us for a liquid product  we have long strived to bring a quantum-factored  concentrated liquid product to fruition.

NOW KNOWN AS THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO (DRC).  I am touched to be able to write this letter to you. It was confidential in nature, given my current situation and situation. I ESCAPE WITH MY HUSBAND AND OUR TWO SONS, GEORGE KONGOLO AND BASHER, FROM THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO (DRC) TO Abidjan, IVORY COAST, WHERE MY FAMILY AND I SETTLED AND LATER MOVED TO MARROCO, WHERE MY HUSBAND LATER DIED OF CANCER DISEASE. HOWEVER, DUE TO THIS SITUATION, WE DECIDED TO EXCHANGE MOST OF MY HUSBAND'S BILLIONS OF DOLLARS DEPOSED IN SWISS BANK AND OTHER COUNTRIES INTO OTHER FORMS OF MONEY ENCODED FOR A SECURE PURPOSE BECAUSE THE NEW HEAD OF STATE (DR) MR. LAURENT CABILI HAS EARNED AN AGREEMENT FROM THE SWISS GOVERNMENT AND OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO FREEZE ALL MY DEAD HUSBAND'S TREASURES SITED IN SOME EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. THAT'S WHY MY CHILDREN AND I DECIDED TO GO TO AFRICA TO INVESTIGATE THE SITUATION UNTIL EVERYTHING WILL IMPROVE, LIKE NOW WHEN PRESIDENT KABILA IS NOT WORRIED AND SON IS TAKING OVER THE BATTLE (JOSEPH KABILA). ONE OF MY LATE HUSBAND'S MOVEMENTS IN THE SOUTHERN OF FRANCE WAS CONFISCATED BY THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT, DURING THIS TIME I HAD TO CHANGE my IDENTITY SO THAT MY INVESTMENTS WOULD NOT BE TRACKED AND CONFISCATED. I HAVE DEPOSED EIGHTEEN MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS ($18,000,000,00) INTO A SECURITY COMPANY FOR SECURITY PURPOSES. THE FUNDS ARE SECURITY ENCODED TO PROTECT THEIR CONTENT. WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS INDICATE YOUR INTEREST IN HELPING US RECEIVE MONEY ON OUR BEHALF. PLEASE CONFIRM THIS MESSAGE SO THAT I CAN INTRODUCE YOU TO MY SON (CONGOLO) WHO HAS A WAY TO CLAIM THE FUNDS. I WANT TO HELP INVEST THIS MONEY, BUT I DON'T WANT MY IDENTITY REVEALED. I ALSO WANT TO BUY REAL ESTATE AND SHARES IN INTERNATIONAL COMPANIES AND ENGAGE IN OTHER SAFE AND NON-SPECULATIVE INVESTMENTS. PLEASE EMPHASIZE THE HIGH LEVEL OF CONFIDENTIALITY THAT THIS BUSINESS REQUIRES AND HOPE THAT YOU WILL NOT BETRAY THE TRUST I HAVE IN YOU. SPECIFICALLY, IF YOU WANT TO HELP US, MY SON WILL INTRODUCE YOU INTO THE BUSINESS PICTURE, TELL YOU WHERE THE FUNDS ARE CURRENTLY, AND DISCUSS OTHER WAYS, INCLUDING REMUNERATION FOR YOUR SERVICES. FOR THIS REASON, WE ASK YOU TO PROVIDE YOUR CONTACT INFORMATION, THAT IS, YOUR PERSONAL PHONE AND FAX NUMBER FOR CONFIDENTIAL PURPOSES. GREETINGS MRS. M. SESE SEKO",1

TINUBU SQUARE LAGOS NIGERIA EMAIL-smith_j@mailsurf.com August 23, 2002 ATTN:PRESIDENT/CEO Strictly Private Business Proposal My name is Mr. Johnson S. Abu and I am the Director of Accounts and Exchange at the Foreign Remittances Department of the Central Bank of Nigeria.  I am writing this letter to you to request your support and cooperation in pursuing this business opportunity in my department.  We discovered that on an account belonging to one of our foreign clients, an American late engineer. John Creek (Junior), an oil trader working for the Federal Government of Nigeria, who was killed along with his entire family, wife and two children, on a Kenyan Airbus (A310-300) KQ430 flight in November 2000. Since we heard about his death, we have expected that his next of kin will come and claim his money as his heir because we cannot withdraw the funds from his account unless someone makes a claim claim application as next of kin of the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. Unfortunately, neither their family member nor distant relative showed up to claim the said fund.  After this discovery, I and other officials from my department agreed to do business with you, transfer the entire amount to your account as the beneficiary of the fund, since no one requested it or discovered that he had an account in our bank. Otherwise, the fund will be returned to the treasury bank as an unclaimed fund.  We agreed that our distribution ratio would be as follows: 30% for you as a foreign partner and 70% for us, officials in my department.  Once this transfer is successfully completed, my colleague and I will come to your country and take care of our share. It is from our 60% that we intend to import computer accessories to my country as part of the recycling fund.  To initiate this transaction, we require you to immediately express your interest by calling me or sending a fax to the above fax number and including your personal contact number. Telephone # Fax # full name and address and designated bank coordinates so that we can submit an application to the appropriate department to obtain the necessary permits before making the transfer.  Please also note that this transaction must be kept strictly confidential due to its nature.  Note: Please remember to include MR.Johnson Smith Abu - Irish Linux Users Group telephone and fax numbers: ilug@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug in case of (un)subscription information.

NOW KNOWN AS THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO (DRC).  I am touched to be able to write this letter to you. It was confidential in nature, given my current situation and situation. I ESCAPE WITH MY HUSBAND AND OUR TWO SONS, GEORGE KONGOLO AND BASHER, FROM THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO (DRC) TO Abidjan, IVORY COAST, WHERE MY FAMILY AND I SETTLED AND LATER MOVED TO MARROCO, WHERE MY HUSBAND LATER DIED OF CANCER DISEASE. HOWEVER, DUE TO THIS SITUATION, WE DECIDED TO EXCHANGE MOST OF MY HUSBAND'S BILLIONS OF DOLLARS DEPOSED IN SWISS BANK AND OTHER COUNTRIES INTO OTHER FORMS OF MONEY ENCODED FOR A SECURE PURPOSE BECAUSE THE NEW HEAD OF STATE (DR) MR. LAURENT CABILI HAS EARNED AN AGREEMENT FROM THE SWISS GOVERNMENT AND OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO FREEZE ALL MY DEAD HUSBAND'S TREASURES SITED IN SOME EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. THAT'S WHY MY CHILDREN AND I DECIDED TO GO TO AFRICA TO INVESTIGATE THE SITUATION UNTIL EVERYTHING WILL IMPROVE, LIKE NOW WHEN PRESIDENT KABILA IS NOT WORRIED AND SON IS TAKING OVER THE BATTLE (JOSEPH KABILA). ONE OF MY LATE HUSBAND'S MOVEMENTS IN THE SOUTHERN OF FRANCE WAS CONFISCATED BY THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT, DURING THIS TIME I HAD TO CHANGE my IDENTITY SO THAT MY INVESTMENTS WOULD NOT BE TRACKED AND CONFISCATED. I HAVE DEPOSED EIGHTEEN MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS ($18,000,000,00) INTO A SECURITY COMPANY FOR SECURITY PURPOSES. THE FUNDS ARE SECURITY ENCODED TO PROTECT THEIR CONTENT. WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS INDICATE YOUR INTEREST IN HELPING US RECEIVE MONEY ON OUR BEHALF. PLEASE CONFIRM THIS MESSAGE SO THAT I CAN INTRODUCE YOU TO MY SON (CONGOLO) WHO HAS A WAY TO CLAIM THE FUNDS. I WANT TO HELP INVEST THIS MONEY, BUT I DON'T WANT MY IDENTITY REVEALED. I ALSO WANT TO BUY REAL ESTATE AND SHARES IN INTERNATIONAL COMPANIES AND ENGAGE IN OTHER SAFE AND NON-SPECULATIVE INVESTMENTS. PLEASE EMPHASIZE THE HIGH LEVEL OF CONFIDENTIALITY THAT THIS BUSINESS REQUIRES AND HOPE THAT YOU WILL NOT BETRAY THE TRUST I HAVE IN YOU. SPECIFICALLY, IF YOU WANT TO HELP US, MY SON WILL INTRODUCE YOU INTO THE BUSINESS PICTURE, TELL YOU WHERE THE FUNDS ARE CURRENTLY, AND DISCUSS OTHER WAYS, INCLUDING REMUNERATION FOR YOUR SERVICES. FOR THIS REASON, WE ASK YOU TO PROVIDE YOUR CONTACT INFORMATION, THAT IS, YOUR PERSONAL PHONE AND FAX NUMBER FOR CONFIDENTIAL PURPOSES. GREETINGS MRS. M. SESE SEKO",1

Also  many  peoplewill send out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead ofonly  5 000 each).Continuing with this example  you send out only 5 000  e-mails.With a 0.2% response  that is only 10 orders for Report #1.Those  10 people resonded by sending out 5 000 e-mails eachfor a total of  50 000.

I made fun of thewhole thing   spouting my knowledge of the population andpercentages involved. I  ""knew"" it wouldn't work. Jodytotally ignored my supposed intelligence  and a few days latershe jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun  of her and was ready to lay the old ""I told you so"" on her whenthe thing  didn't work. Well  the laugh was on me! Within3 weeks she had  received 50 responses. Within the next 45days she had received a total  of $147 200.00 all cash!I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her  ""hobby"".

My wife Jody and I  live in Chicago.I am an accountant with a major US Corporation and I  makepretty good money. When I received this program I grumbledto  Jody about receiving ""junk mail"". I made fun of thewhole thing   spouting my knowledge of the population andpercentages involved. I  ""knew"" it wouldn't work. Jodytotally ignored my supposed intelligence  and a few days latershe jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun  of her and was ready to lay the old ""I told you so"" on her whenthe thing  didn't work. Well  the laugh was on me! Within3 weeks she had  received 50 responses. Within the next 45days she had received a total  of $147 200.00 all cash!I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her  ""hobby"". Mitchell Wof  Chicago   Illinois----------------------------------------------------------------""Not  being the gambling type  it took me several weeks tomake up my mind to  participate in this plan. But conservativethat I am  I decided that  the initial investment was so littlethat there was just no way that I  wouldn't get enough ordersto at least get my money back. I was  surprised when I foundmy medium sized post office box crammed with  orders. I made$319 210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing  about thisdeal is that it does not matter where people live.  Theresimply isn't a better investment with a faster return andso  big"". Dan Sondstrom  Alberta   Canada---------------------------------------------------------------""I  had received this program before. I deleted it  but laterI wondered if  I should hav given it a try. Of course  Ihad no idea who to contact to  get another copy  so I had towait until I was e-mailed again by someone else  . . . . . . . 11 months passed then it luckily came again. I did not  delete this one! I made more than $490 000 on my first tryand all  the money came within 22 weeks"". Susan De  Suza  New York   NY--------------------------------------------------------------""It  really is a great opportunity to make relatively easymoney with little cost  to you.

Message ID: X-Mailer: Atlas Mailer 2.0 Content Type: Text/Plain; charset=utf-8 Content transfer encoding: 8-bit OWOLABI and ASSOCIATE FALOMO IKOYI. LAGOS – NIGERIA.   YOUR TYPE OF ATTN.     RE: REQUEST FOR ACTION FOR COMMON BENEFITS.  I humbly ask for your understanding in sending this message if its content is not consistent with your personal and business ethics. I apologize in advance.  I am Barrister Kola Owolabi (Legal Adviser) I represent the estate of Alhaji Ishmaila Ibrahim Gwarzo. Alhaji Gwarzo was the Chief Security Adviser to the then military leader of the country (Nigeria) in the person of General Sani Abacha who died on June 8, 1998. With the advent of a new democratic dispensation in the country under the leadership of Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo (Rtd), my client has been a victim of severe persecution due to the sensitive position he held in the last military regime, and is currently under house arrest confined solely to the boundaries of his village.  The main purpose of this message is to inform you about a business proposition that may interest you. My client informed me of the existence of funds deposited with an overseas security company. This fund was created from collateral votes that were allocated to my client's portfolio during his tenure as chief security advisor to the then-president. What happened was that he transferred some of the funds from the vaults of the Central Bank of Nigeria to this security unit to purchase weapons and ammunition for the personal security unit of the then president. However, before the purchase was made, the president died. My client decided to keep it to himself because all his assets have been confiscated by the current regime. However, because he is in prison, he cannot go out and influence the change of ownership in his favor.  My client has tasked me with finding an overseas partner to help him facilitate his change of ownership. The certificate of deposit and the code needed to complete this project are in my possession.  The funds in question amount to 17.6 million dollars (seventeen million six hundred thousand US dollars only). If this proposal interests you, you can contact me via my email address so that we can discuss the basics of this venture.  I remain very much obliged.  Attorney Kola Owolabi (JP). Main partner.

I found you while looking for a reliable and reputable person who will carry out a very confidential transaction involving the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account.   A consortium of international oil companies signed a number of contracts for N.N.P.C. The original value of these contracts was intentionally inflated to USD 12,320,000.00 (twelve million three hundred and twenty thousand US dollars). This amount has already been approved and is ready to be transferred as the companies that actually executed these contracts have been fully paid and the projects have been officially commissioned.    Accordingly, my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the entire amount to your account for later payment as the Code of Conduct Office (Civil Service Law) prohibits us, as civil servants, from maintaining and/or opening foreign accounts in our name. Needless to say, the trust placed in you at this point is enormous, in return we have agreed to offer you 20% of the transferred amount, while 10% will be used for unforeseen expenses (internal and external) between both parties during the transaction, you will be obliged to transfer the balance to other accounts in a timely manner.   The highest level of the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of Nigeria has developed rules for the immediate transfer of funds within 7 working days, provided that you meet the above conditions.  We ensure that your role is risk-free. To give this transaction the legality it deserves and for the mutual safety of your funds, the entire approval procedure will be officially and legally conducted using your name or the name of any company you may designate as a beneficiary of Bonefide.  Once again, I want you to understand that after over twenty-five years of civil service in my country, I do not want my image and career to deteriorate. This matter should therefore be treated with the utmost secrecy and urgency that it deserves.   Please let me know if you would like to help by replying to this email and explaining your position on this transaction. If it is positive, we will take further steps to provide you with all the details of this real transaction.  I want to assure you that this business proposition is 100% risk-free because we have done our homework well.   I have full faith that you will protect our interests by treating this agreement as strictly confidential as we continue to perform government service from which we intend to withdraw with full honor.  We are asking you to expedite action as we are behind schedule to enable us to include this carryover in the next tranche, which will be new quarterly payments for fiscal year 2002. Thank you and God bless you.  Dr. James Alabi",1

LIST OF FIVE NAMES**************************** ________________________________________________  GUIDE# 1: ""How to be A More Effective Public Speaker"" Order Guide #1 for US$10.00 CASH from: (In addition to Guide #1  you will receive a valuable marketing Guide ""A Million Bucks From the Internet""  free of charge)  Derrick Nguyen	 9530 Whitmore St	 El Monte  CA 91733	 USA ________________________________________________  GUIDE # 2: ""How to Give a Business Presentation"" Order Guide # 2 for US$10.00 CASH from:  Tim Fai GPO Box 260 Macau (via Hong Kong) ________________________________________________  GUIDE# 3: ""How to Write More Effectively"" Order Guide # 3 for US$10.00 CASH from:  Luis Pastor Apartado 81 48080 Bilbao Spain ________________________________________________  GUIDE # 4: ""What to do at a Social Function"" Order Guide # 4 for US$10.00 CASH from:  Chester Waldvogel 11 Chestnut Way Berlin  MD 21811 USA ________________________________________________  GUIDE # 5: ""How To Sharpen Your Mind"" Order Guide # 5 for US$10.00 CASH from:  J. Siden Krondikesvagen 54 A 83147 Ostersund Sweden ________________________________________________ END OF LIST OF FIVE NAMES*********************  Step 2.  These Guides will be emailed to you.  Save these Guides on your computer's hard disk as other people will be ordering these Guides from you  paying you for them and you will need to email the Guides to the new buyers.  Step 3.  From the list of names above  delete the name and address of the person shown under GUIDE#5  and replace that slot with the name and address of the person from GUIDE #4's slot.  Be sure to copy the name and address exactly as shown. Check the address again.  Step 4.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #4  and replace with the name and address from GUIDE #3's slot.  Step 5.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #3  and replace with the name and address from  GUIDE#2's slot.  Step 6.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #2  and replace with the name and address from GUIDE #1's slot.  Step 7.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #1  and replace with YOUR OWN NAME AND ADDRESS. This step is how your own name and address is entered into the list of names to receive orders for the Guides. Eventually  your own name will go down the list of names until you have reached GUIDE #5  and then be dropped from the list. The key point is that the number of people ordering Guides from you will grow larger the lower down the list your name goes.  Step 8.  Once you have completed this new list  send out this new email (which shows your name under GUIDE #1) to as many email addresses as possible  as many as 100 000 emails or even more.  The greater the number of mailings you make  potentially the greater the number of people who will order the GUIDE #1 from you.  These people will then make new emails to send out to their addresses with the email showing your name under GUIDE #2  and so on.  This is all you need to do.  If you wish to read the rest of this email message  then do so.  If not  just do the 8 steps shown above. Remember  the key point is to send out as many emails as possible in step 8  and to encourage and help those who purchase the Guides from you to send out emails of their own.  Do NOT change anything other than what is instructed. Because if you do  it will not work for you.  Your immediate reaction might be: Why not replace all the names on the list with the names of your spouse  kids  relatives  and friends. That might seem to you like a clever move because new buyers will be sending their money to these people.  But that move is the exact opposite of what is to your benefit. What will benefit you most is having people who will send out emails  seek new buyers  and provide assistance to new buyers. If the people you slip into that list aren't going to be sending new emails  you're only hurting yourself by effectively closing down the program with your name on top of the list of the names that you have inserted.  There wouldn't be new buyers coming in. So  your sly maneuver will gain you exactly zero!  Furthermore  if you have done the work  and your name has worked its way to further down the list  by then you deserve the rewards and earnings from that effort  and it would be unethical for anyone to remove your name for whatever reason.  Don't do it to others. Remember  honesty reaps the reward!!!  You may have a concern that after sending the total $50 to the five people on the list that one of the people will just take your money  and not send you the Guide.  Well  rest assured.  As we said above  it's to our benefit to have you as a satisfied buyer who will actively send out emails to find new buyers.  So don't think the people on the list will try to cheat you or to ""stiff"" you for $10.00.  The people on the list would rather have you working hard because your effort will benefit them as well as you.  Later on  when other buyers send you the order to buy the Guides  fulfill your end of the deal by sending the ordered Guide to the buyer.  Don't cheat. Provide efficient and honest service and we will all benefit. ******END OF SUMMARY************************  =======REST OF MESSAGE======================  With easy-to-use email tools and opt-in email  success in this business is now well within the capabilities of ordinary people who may not have done any internet marketing before.

If you believe direct marketing via the internet is the way sales and marketing will be done in the future  then the experience you will gain here could be a real boost in your work career  possibly even providing a new career for you.  = PRINT THIS MESSAGE FOR FUTURE REFERENCE =  If you want to make serious money  read this message until you understand it completely and feel confident to follow through on what it advises.  FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION ABOVE AND YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS CAN COME TRUE!  Remember  this method has been tested  and if you alter it  it will NOT work!  This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You are offering a product for sale to a buyer. Treat it as such and you can see money coming to you  in a reasonable period of time  depending on the collective efforts of yourself and the others on the list of five.  =========================================== *** Take this entire email  with the modified list of names  and save it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.  There are 2 methods to get this venture going:  METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK EMAIL LEGALLY ===========================================  Let's say that you start small  to see how it goes  and that you and those involved send out only 5 000 emails each. Let's also assume that the mailing receives only a 0.1% (1/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much better but let's just say it is only 0.1%). Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of emails instead of only 5 000 each.  Out of your 5 000 emails and a 0.1% response  that is only 5 orders for Guide # 1. Those 5 people who responded also send out 5 000 emails each for a total of 25 000. Out of those 25 000 emails only 0.1% responded with orders. That's 25 people who responded and ordered Guide # 2.  Those 25 people mail out 5 000 e-mails each for a total of 125 000 emails. The 0.1% response to that is 125 orders for Guide # 3. Those 125 people send 5 000 emails each for a total of 625 000 emails sent out. The 0.1% response is 625 orders for Guide # 4.  Those 625 people send out 5 000 emails each for a total of 3 125 000 emails. The 0.1% response to that is  3 125 orders for Guide # 5  or $31 250 at $10 per Guide.  This may seem a small amount to you  but remember we used a very low response rate with a small number of emails being sent out.  See what happens if you can get the response rate up just slightly.  If Response Rate is 0.1%  income from Guides #1 - #5 is: $50+250+1 250+6 250+31 250 = $39 050 (as above)  If Response Rate is 0.15%  income from Guides #1 - #5 is: $75+560+4 220+31 640+237 300 = $273 795  If Response Rate is 0.2%  income from Guides #1 - #5 is: $100+1 000+10 000+100 000+1 000 000 = $1 111 100  Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100 000 emails each or more?  From the example above  you can see the power of leveraging  that is  how much greater is the amount of money from a small increase in the response rate.  There are over 200 million people on the internet worldwide and counting  with thousands more coming online every day.  METHOD # 2: PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET ===========================================  Advertising on the net is very  very inexpensive and there are Many FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the internet will get a response. We strongly suggest you start with  Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $10 you receive  all you must do is email the Guide the buyer ordered. Always provide same day service.  The people you buy these Guides from will assist and advise you how to get the large number of email addresses that you need to send the new email containing your name and address.  In return  when others buy the Guides from you  you also should help those buyers to resell the Guides to their email addresses.  This will benefit you because your name would be further down the list  and their new buyers will buy from you.  This is no different than ""customer service"" in the retail or the  ""bricks and mortars"" business.  ===========AVAILABLE GUIDES ============== The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is illegal or somehow  ""wrong"". It is simply about time. Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved  etc. Concealing it is simply so no one can SEE there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you.  ORDER EACH GUIDE BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Always send a single $10 bill (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Guide.  Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is hidden by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of paper  write the NUMBER & the NAME of the Guide you are ordering  YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address.  Be sure to address the envelope correctly and put the proper amount of stamps to mail the envelope.  PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE GUIDES NOW FROM THE NAME AND ADDRESS LIST SHOWN AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS EMAIL ________________________________________________ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES  === If you do not receive at least 10 orders for GUIDE #1 within 2 weeks  continue sending emails until you do.  === Two to three weeks after you receive 10 orders  you should receive 100 orders or more for GUIDE #2. If not  continue advertising or sending emails until you do.  Once you have received 100 or more orders for GUIDE # 2  YOU CAN SEE THE PROGRAM IS WORKING  and cash should continue coming in! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER:  Continue to assist new buyers with advice and instruction on how to send out more emails. You can KEEP TRACK of progress by noting which guides people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF EMAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate !!! =========================================== A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: You have just received information that can give you financial freedom to really change your life  but I don't wish to kid you:  This requires A BIT OF EFFORT. You can make more money in the next few weeks and months than you have ever imagined. Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED.  Remember to email the revised copy of this email after you have put your name and address in GUIDE#1 and moved others to #2 .....# 5 slots as instructed above. One of the people you send this to may send out 100 000 or more emails and your name will be on every one of them. Remember  the more you send out the more potential buyers you will reach.  IT IS UP TO YOU!  ORDER THE GUIDES NOW AND EMBARK ON THE ROAD TO FINANCIAL SECURITY!  Upon your purchase of any GUIDE #1 through #5  the Copyright owner assigns to you two important rights: (1) The right to resell and to distribute via the internet the GUIDE that you have purchased  and (2) the right to assign to your buyer of the GUIDE  the further right for your buyer to resell that GUIDE.  Included in your purchase of Guide #1 is a valuable report on how to market on the Internet. It's free of charge and will give you the tools you need.  The right to print any of the material contained in the GUIDES is reserved exclusively for the copyright owner.  Your right to resell and to distribute copies of the GUIDE applies only to the internet and/or world wide web via electronic distribution. YOU MAY NOT PRINT OUT THE GUIDES TO SELL OR DISTRIBUTE IN ANY WAY.

Pick #2 – ENBC started a surge of over 200%, reaching a high of over 300%… Our Latest Discovery: XRMD – Several investment reporters mentioned XrayMedia in the 2001/02 financial year. At the time, we felt that the advertising industry presented a huge opportunity for the company's direct sourcing technology solutions, and so far the company has delivered. Although the company raised only $2 million in two years of developing its technology, it dramatically increased its revenue streams by opening a financial services division, increasing expected Live Media Marketplace revenues to $3-5 million in fiscal 2003, leading to growth in 2004 to 15-25mm. This extraordinary growth becomes more understandable when we look at the savings that the direct sourcing model generates for advertisers and retailers. The company saves ad buyers up to 70% on costs by dramatically increasing the effect of wholesale pricing, saving time and effort, lowering phone and fax bills, while providing free bulk information opportunities to negotiate ad buying and selling opportunities using secure, state-of-the-art negotiation technology in real time on the Internet we have never seen anything like this!  How does the company do it?   XrayMedia (OTCBB: XRMD) The company founded XrayMedia in March 2000 to create a ""mass resource for the advertising industry."" Live negotiation technology and ad buy financing highlight the company's strengths, serving clients both large and small in the United States and abroad with advertising opportunities delivered directly from the media and the public. *** By using its own software, it brings sophistication to the industry, which significantly speeds up ordering and finds opportunities based on user criteria, resulting in savings for both ad buyers and the ad sellers it serves.   Their source-to-business model eliminates the two levels of hurdles (sourcing and limited opportunities) and provides clients with massive advertising selection and live negotiations that are designed to provide a fundamentally low cost base to find the right advertising opportunities for all businesses at no cost .  While investors were recklessly throwing money at loss-making tech companies, here was a company that would grow revenue from $1 million to $25 million in three years and significantly increase profitability with little funding. XrayMedia is one of the best performing sectors since 9/11 and we believe XrayMedia is likely to break its 52-week high of $00.19 soon.   *** Listed on the OTCBB and listed with an extremely low market valuation of less than 10 mm.  *** Opened accounts with over hundreds of buyers and sellers, including some of the world's largest media buyers, major and smaller retailers.   *** Attracting interest from major investment bankers and analysts is also a possible takeover target for major retailers at some point.  *** The largest order for financing advertising was received, for the amount of over PLN 500,000. dollars when accumulating subsequent contracts.  *** Revenue growth is expected to be dramatic, ranging from $1 million to $5 million.   ***The company is expected to report a profitable quarter with revenues and earnings increasing ""significantly"" as it begins fiscal 2003 in January.

We are looking for a reliable person to help us transfer the amount of twenty million five hundred thousand US dollars ($20,500,000). Via international bank transfer Cash in any First World country.

We are left with a balance of $20.5 million within the inflated amount that we have devised and estimated for our own use.

Bank manager of the Lagos branch of Diamond Bank of Nigeria. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 1999, FOREIGN OIL CONSULTANT/CONTRACTOR AT THE FEDERAL MINISTRY OF AVIATION Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered (fixed) deposit with my branch for twelve calendar months in the amount of $25,000,000.00 (twenty-five million dollars). After reaching maturity, I sent a routine notification to his mailing address but received no response. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally learned from his employers, the FEDERAL MINISTRY OF AVIATION, that Mr. Barry Kelly had died in a car accident. Upon further investigation, I learned that he had died without leaving a will, and all attempts to locate his next of kin had been unsuccessful. I therefore made further inquiries and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly had not declared any relatives or relatives on all of his official documents, including his bank deposit documents with my bank. The $25,000,000.00 amount is still in my bank and the interest is rolled over to the principal amount at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward for it. Under Nigerian law, after 6 (six) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian government if no one files a claim for the funds. As a result, I just managed to send this fund to the Netherlands through a security company called GLOBAL& BASIC FINANCIAL COMPANY.  Please provide your full names and address immediately in order to prepare the necessary documents and certificates that will make you the owner of this fund in the security company. I will use the services of a lawyer to prepare and notarize the changes and obtain the necessary documents and a letter of probate and administration in your favor. There is no risk because all formalities related to this transaction will be handled by the Representative, and my position as Branch Manager guarantees the successful completion of this transaction. If you are interested, please respond immediately to your private e-mail address. Once I receive your response, I will provide more details and relevant documents to help you understand the transaction. Please maintain the utmost confidentiality and rest assured that this transaction will be most beneficial for both of us as I will need your help to invest my share in your country.  I am waiting for your urgent reply via my e-mail: Thank you and best regards.   MR. IKE EJOH",1

Please see the bottom of this message for further information and removal instructions.   PARENTS OF 15 - YEAR OLD - FIND $71 000 CASH HIDDEN IN HIS CLOSET!  Does this headline look familiar? Of course it does. You most likely have just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program (USA). And reported elsewhere in the world (including my neck of the woods - New Zealand). His mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-old sons closet. Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash. Five-dollar bills  twenties  fifties and hundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in labelled piles.  ""My first thought was that he had robbed a bank""  says the 41-year-old woman  ""There was over $71 000 dollars in that bag --that's more than my husband earns in a year"".  The woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership where he worked to tell him what she had discovered.He came home right away and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up.  Little did they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet.  As it turns out  the boy had been sending out  via E-mail  a type of  ""Report"" to E-mail addresses that he obtained off the Internet. Everyday after school for the past 2 months  he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom.  ""I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the heck  I put my name on it like the instructions said and I started sending it out""  says the clever 15-year-old.  The E-mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained instructions to send one $5 dollar bill to each person on the list  then delete the address at the top and move the others addresses Down   and finally to add your name to the top of the list.  The letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand dollars in five-dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the 5-address list. ""I get junk E-mail all the time  and really did not think it was going to work""  the boy continues.  Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail  the Post Office Box that his parents had gotten him for his video-game magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines  but envelopes containing $5 bills.  ""About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post office and my box had 1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it. There was also a yellow slip that said I had to go up to the [post office] counter. I thought I was in trouble or something (laughs)"". He goes on  ""I went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me. I had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because I could not carry it all"".  Over the next few weeks  the boy continued sending out the E-mail.""  The money just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet  barely had time for my homework"".He had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $5 bills for twenties   fifties and hundreds.  ""I didn't want the banks to get suspicious so I kept riding to different banks with like five thousand at a time in my backpack. I would usually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the money] and he was outside waiting for me.One time the lady gave me a really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me and my dad would have to come in and do it  but I just rode to the next bank down the street (laughs).""  Surprisingly  the boy did not have any reason to be afraid.The reporting news   team examined and investigated the so-called ""chain-letter"" the boy was sending out and found that it was not a chain-letter at all.In fact  it was completely legal according to US Postal and Lottery Laws  Title 18  Section 1302 and 1341  or Title 18  Section 3005 in the US code  also in the code of federal regulations  Volume 16  Sections 255 and 436  which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received.  Every five-dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read  ""Please send me report number XYX"".This simple note made the letter legal because he was exchanging a service (A Report on how-to) for a  five-dollar fee.  [This is the end of the media release. If you would like to understand how the system works and get your $71 000 - please continue reading. What  appears below is what the 15 year old was sending out on the net -  YOU CAN USE IT TOO - just follow the simple instructions].  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ BE FINANCIALLY FREE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!! Before you say ""Bull""  please read the following. This is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the  Internet  a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below  to see if it really can make people money. The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal. Their findings proved once and for all that there are ""absolutely NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can follow the simple instructions  they are bound to make some megabucks with only $25 out of pocket cost"".   DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED  IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER.   Note* follow the directons below  I had best results the second time when I hired a bulk email service in addition to following the reports instructions.  In order for all of us to be successful  many  many emails must be sent so that the returns are many. I have been extremely successful using the following company. They send out the offers  and all I do is accept money for reports  then I send back to the people as soon as possible.  This is what one had to say: ""Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I was  approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment  I received total $610 470.00 in 21 weeks  with money still coming in"".  Pam Hedland  Fort Lee  New Jersey.  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Here is another testimonial: ""This program has been around for a long time  but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again in the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to come in. First month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made a total of $290 000.00. So far  in the past 8 months by re-entering the program  I have made over $710 000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change anything."" More testimonials later but first   PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE  ++++ Order all 5 reports shown on the list below +++ For each report  send $5 CASH  THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE  REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT  CORNER in case of any mail problems.   When you place your order  make sure you order each of the 5 reports. You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer. Within a few days you will receive  vie e-mail  each of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1 000's of people who will order them from you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case something happens to your computer.   IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report  or their sequence on the list  in any way other than what is instructed below in step ""1 through 6"" or you will loose out on majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this works  you will also see how it does not work if you change it. Remember  this method has been tested  and if you alter  it will NOT work!!! People have tried to put their friends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money. But it does not work this way. Believe us  we all have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not try to change anything other than what is instructed. Because if you do  it will not work for you. Remember  honesty reaps the reward!!!   1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports  take this advertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # 5. This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune. 2.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT #5. 3.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT #4. 4.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT #3. 5.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT #2 6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.   PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY! +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++   **** Take this entire letter  with the modified list of names  and save it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES. Save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data. To assist you with marketing your business on the internet  the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally  where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more. There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going:   METHOD #1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++   Let's say that you decide to start small  just to see how it goes  and we will assume You and those involved send out only 5 000e-mails each. Let's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5 000 each). Continuing with this example  you send out only 5 000 e-mails.   With a 0.2% response  that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded by sending out 5 000 e-mail each for a total of 50 000. Out of those 50 000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That equals 100 people responded and ordered Report # 2.  Those 100 people mail out 5 000 e-mails each for a total of 500 000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report #3.  Those 1000 people send out 5 000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10 000 orders for Report #4.  Those 10 000 people send out 5 000 e-mails each for a total of 50 000 000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100 000 orders for Report #5. THAT'S 100 000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=$500 000.00 (half million). Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 +2.....$500 + 3.....$5 000 + 4..... $50 000 + 5..... $500 000....... Grand Total=$555 550.00   NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT  YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY!  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ REMEMBER FRIEND  THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5 000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100 000e-mails each or more? There are over 150 million people on  the Internet worldwide and counting. Believe me  many people will do just that  and more!   METHOD #2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will easily get a larger response.   We strongly suggest you start with Method #1 and add METHOD #2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive  all you must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day service on all orders. This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out with your name and address on it  will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report.  =ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper or aluminum foil. On one of those sheets of paper  Write the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you are ordering  YOUR E-MAIL  ADDRESS and your name and postal address.   PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW: +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ REPORT #1: The Insider's Guide to Advertising for Free on the Net  Order Report #1 from: R. R. PO Box 18048 Chicago  IL 60618 __________________________________________________________  REPORT #2: The Insider's Guide to Sending Bulk e-mail on the Net  Order Report #2 from: GM Boland 353 Jonestown Rd.

If you did not  continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do.  +++ Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report #2  YOU CAN RELAX  because the system is already working for you  and the cash will continue to roll in! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your name is moved down on the list  you are placed in front of a Different report. You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate from this business!!!  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: You have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life  with NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can make more money in the next few weeks and months than you have ever imagined. Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way. It works exceedingly well as it is now.  Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your name and address in Report#1 and moved others to #2 thru #5 as instructed above. One of the people you send this to may send out 100 000 or more e-mails and your name will be on every one of them. Remember though  the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach. So my friend  I have given you the ideas  information   materials and opportunity to become financially independent.  IT IS UP TO YOU NOW!  ++++++++++++++++ MORE TESTIMONIALS ++++++++++++++++ ""My name is Mitchell. My wife  Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving  ""junk mail"". I made fun of the whole thing  spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved. I ""knew"" it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of her  and was ready to lay the old  ""I told you so"" on her when the thing didn't work. Well  the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she had received total $ 147 200.00....all cash! I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her ""hobby"".  Mitchell Wolf  Chicago  Illinois  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ ""Not being the gambling type  it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am  I decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back"". ""I was surprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with orders. I made $319 210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return and so big"".  Dan Sondstrom  Alberta  Canada  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ ""I had received this program before. I deleted it  but later I wondered if I should have given it a try. Of course  I had no idea who to contact to get another copy  so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone else......11 months passed then it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one! I made more than $490 000 on my first try and all the money came within 22 weeks"".

As Seen on TV! 65000$+ X-Reply-To: MakeMoney@legally.com Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1 Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit  THE ULTIMATE WAY TO WORK FROM HOME  THE BEST MONEY MAKING SYSTEM OF ALL!!  AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV  As seen on 20/20 and many other credible references. This is NOT a scam.  I hope this is ok that I send you this. If you aren't interested  just  simply delete it.  READ THIS MESSAGE if you are like me and want more than your lousy  weekly paycheck. Make more in a few months than last year at work.  Believe it  work it.  This really works  don't make the same mistake I made. I deleted this  4-5 times before finally giving it a try. Within 2 weeks the orders  (money)  started coming in just like the plan below said it would. Give it a  try!!  You will be glad you did.  Thanks and Good Luck! You won't need luck  just keep reading. Don't  delete this!!!  ------------------------------------------------------  First read about how a 15 year old made $71 000. See below....  AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV: This is the media report.  PARENTS OF 15 - YEAR OLD - FIND $71 000 CASH HIDDEN  IN HIS CLOSET!  Does this headline look familiar? Of course it does.  You most likely have just seen this story recently  featured on a major nightly news program (USA).  And reported elsewhere in the world (including my neck  of the woods - New Zealand). His mother was cleaning  and putting laundry away when she came across a large  brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath  some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her  15-year-old sons closet.  Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got  when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash.  Five-dollar bills  twenties  fifties and hundreds -  all neatly rubber-banded in labeled piles.  ""My first thought was that he had robbed a bank""   says the 41-year-old woman  ""There was over $71 000  dollars in that bag -- that's more than my husband  earns in a year"".  The woman immediately called her husband at the  car-dealership where he worked to tell him what she  had discovered. He came home right away and they  drove together to the boys school and picked him up.  Little did they suspect that where the money came from  was more shocking than actually finding it in  the closet.  As it turns out  the boy had been sending out  via  E-mail  a type of ""Report"" to E-mail addresses that he  obtained off the Internet. Everyday after school for  the past 2 months  he had been doing this right on his  computer in his bedroom.  ""I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the  heck  I put my name on it like the instructions said  and I started sending it out""  says the clever  15-year-old.  The E-mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained  instructions to send one $5 dollar bill to each person  on the list  then delete the address at the top and  move the others addresses down  and finally to add  your name to the top of the list.  The letter goes on to state that you would receive  several thousand dollars in five-dollar bills within 2  weeks if you sent out the letter with your  name at the top of the 5-address list. ""I get junk  E-mail all the time  and really did not think it was  going to work""  the boy continues.  Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail   the Post Office Box that his parents had gotten him  for his video-game magazine subscriptions began to  fill up with not magazines  but envelopes containing  $5 bills.  ""About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post  office and my box had 1 magazine and about 300  envelops stuffed in it. There was also a yellow slip  that said I had to go up to the [post office] counter.  I thought I was in trouble or something (laughs)"". He  goes on  ""I went up to the counter and they had a  whole box of more mail for me. I had to ride back  home and empty out my backpack because I could not  carry it all"".  Over the next few weeks  the boy continued sending  out the E-mail. ""The money just kept coming in and I  just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet   barely had time for my homework"". He had also  been riding his bike to several of the banks in his  area and exchanging the $5 bills for twenties  fifties  and hundreds.  ""I didn't want the banks to get suspicious so I kept  riding to different banks with like five thousand at a  time in my backpack. I would usually tell the lady at  the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to  exchange the money and he was outside waiting for me.  One time the lady gave me a really strange look and  told me that she would not be able to do it for me and  my dad would have to come in and do it  but I just  rode to the next bank down the street (laughs).""  Surprisingly  the boy did not have any reason to be  afraid. The reporting news team examined and  investigated the so-called ""chain-letter"" the boy was  sending out and found that it was not a chain-letter  at all. In fact  it was completely legal according to  US Postal and Lottery Laws  Title 18  Section 1302 and  1341  or Title 18  Section 3005 in the US code  also  in the code of federal regulations  Volume 16   Sections 255 and 436  which state a product or service  must be exchanged for money received.  Every five-dollar bill that he received contained a  little note that read  ""Please send me report number  XYX"".This simple note made the letter legal because he  was exchanging a service (A Report on how-to) for a  five-dollar fee.  [This is the end of the media release. If you would  like to understand how the system works and get your  $71 000 - please continue reading. What appears below  is what the 15 year old was sending out on the net -  YOU CAN USE IT TOO - just follow the simple  instructions].  THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET !  ==================================================  You will Make over half million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your  home!!  Before you say ''Bull''  please read the following. This is the  letter you have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the  popularity of this letter on the Internet  a national weekly news  program  recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program  described below  to see if it really can make people money. The show  also  investigated whether or not the program was legal.  Their findings proved once and for all that there are ''absolutely NO  Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can -follow  the simple instructions  they are bound to make some mega bucks with only  $25 out of pocket cost''.  DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS  PROGRAM HAS  ATTAINED  IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER.  This is what one had to say: '' Thanks to this profitable opportunity.  I was approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so  glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for  the minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment  I received  total  $610 470.00 in 21 weeks  with money still coming in''.  Pam Hedland  Fort Lee  New Jersey.  ========================================================= =======Here is  another testimonial: ''' this program has been around for a  long time but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this  again in the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the  simple instructions and wallaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to  come  in. First month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that  made a total of $290 000.00. So far  in the past 8 months by re-entering  the  program  I have made over $710 000.00 and I am playing it again. The  key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change  anything.'' More testimonials later but first:  ===== PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE ========  $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ $$$$$$$$  If you would like to make at least $500 000 every 4 to 5 months easily  and comfortably  please read the following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and  AGAIN!!!  $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ $$$$$$$$  FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND YOUR FINANCIAL  DREAMS WILL COME  TRUE  GUARANTEED!  INSTRUCTIONS:  ================Order all 5 reports shown on the list below  =================  For each report  send $5 CASH  THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT  YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose  name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN  ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail  problems.  === When you place your order  make sure you order each of the 5  reports.  You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer  and resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5=$25.00.  Within a few days you will receive  via e-mail  each of the 5 reports  from these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will  be accessible for you to send to the 1 000's of people who will order them  from you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk  in case something happens to your computer.  IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed  next to each report  or their sequence on the list  in any way other  than what is instructed below in step '' 1 through 6 '' or you will  loose out on majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this  works  you will also see how it does not work if you change it. Remember   this  method has been tested  and if you alter  it will NOT work !!!

Remember  honesty reaps the reward!!!  1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports  take this advertisement  and REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT #5.

Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.  4.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.  5.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2  6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.  PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY!  ========================================================= =======  **** Take this entire letter  with the modified list of names  and save it  on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.  Save this on a disk as well just in case you loose any data. To assist  you with marketing your business on the internet  the 5 reports you  purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which  includes how to send bulk e-mails legally  where to find thousands of  free  classified ads and much more. There are 2 Primary methods to get this  venture going:  METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY  ========================================================= =======  Let's say that you decide to start small  just to see how it goes  and  we will assume You and those involved send out only 5 000 e-mails each.  Let's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the  response  could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many  people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5 000  each).Continuing with this example  you send out only 5 000 e-mails.  With a 0.2% response  that is only 10 orders for report # 1  Those 10 people responded by sending out 5 000 e-mail each for a total  of 50 000.  Out of those 50 000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's=100  people responded and ordered Report # 2.  Those 100 people mail out 5 000 e-mails each for a total of 500 000  e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.  Those 1000 people send out 5 000 e-mails each for a total of 5  million e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10 000 orders  for Report! # 4. Whose 10 000 people send out 5 000 e-mails each for a  total of  50 000 000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100 000  orders for  Report # 5 THAT'S 100 000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=$500 000.00 (half  million).  Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500  + 3.....$5 000 + 4..... $50 000 + 5..... $500 000 ........ Grand  Total=$555 550.00  NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE  WORST POSSIBLERESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU  CALCULATE IT  YOU WILL STILL  MAKE A LOT OF MONEY !  ========================================================= =======  REMEMBER FRIEND  THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING  OUT  OF 5 000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if  everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100 000e-mails  each or more? There are over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide  and counting. Believe me  many people will do just that  and more!  METHOD # 2 : BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET  ========================================================= =======  Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are  hundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the  Internet will easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you  start with Method # 1and add METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you  receive  all you must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's  it. Always provide  same day service on all orders.  This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out  with your  name and address on it  will be prompt because they can not advertise  until they receive the report.  ===================AVAILABLE REPORTS  ==========================  ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always  send  $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure  the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On  one of those sheets of paper  Write the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you  are ordering   YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address.  PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW :  ========================================================= =======  REPORT #1 ""The Insider's Guide to Advertising for Free on the Net""  Order Report #1 from:  K.Palludan  9550 Summersweet Ct.  Las Vegas  Nevada 89123  USA  ________________________________________________________________ ______  REPORT #2 ""'The insider's Guide to Sending Bulk e-mail on the Net'  Order Report #2 from:  Kris Estes  3055 Casey Drive #203  Las Vegas  Nevada 89120  ________________________________________________________________ ______  REPORT #3 ""'Secret to Multilevel Marketing on the Net""  Order Report #3 from :  P. Clement  601 St-Malo Est  Ile Bizard  Quebec H9C2P2  CANADA  ________________________________________________________________ ______  REPORT #4 ""'How to become a Millionaire Utilizing MLM and the Net""  Order Report #4 from:  David Carpenter  13 Dutch lane  Hazlet  New Jersey 07732  USA  ________________________________________________________________ _____  REPORT #5 ""'How to send out one Million e-mails for FREE""  Order Report #5 from:  S. Lasley  4230 Edgewood Circle  Idaho Falls  Idaho 83406  USA  ________________________________________________________________ _____  $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES  $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$  Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:  === If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 2  weeks  continue sending e-mails until you do.  === After you have received 10 orders  2 to 3 weeks after that you  should receive 100 orders or more for REPORT # 2. If you did not  continue  advertising or sending e-mails until you do.  === Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report # 2  YOU CAN  RELAX  because the system is already working for you  and the cash will  continue to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your  name  is moved down on the list  you are placed in front of a Different report.  You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report  people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME  SEND  ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS  AGAIN. There is NO  LIMIT to the income you can generate from this business !!!  ========================================================= =======  FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM:  You have just received information that can give you financial freedom  for the rest of your life  with NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT.  You can make more money in the next few weeks and months than you have  ever imagined. Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change  it  in  any way. It works exceedingly well as it is now.  Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put  your name and address in Report #1 and moved others to #2 ...........# 5  as  instructed above. One of the people you send this to may send out  100 000 or more e-mails and your name will be on every one of them.  Remember  though  the more you send out the more potential customers! you will  reach. So  my friend  I have given you the ideas  information  materials and  opportunity to become financially independent. IT IS UP TO YOU NOW !  ====================== MORE  TESTIMONIALS======================  '' My name is Mitchell. My wife  Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an  accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good  money. When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving  ''junk mail''. I made fun of the whole thing  spouting my knowledge of  the population and percentages involved. I ''knew'' it wouldn't work. Jody  totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in  with  both feet. I made merciless fun of her  and was ready to lay the old  ''I told you so'' on her when the thing didn't work. Well  the laugh was  on me!  Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she  had  received total $ 147 200.00 ........... all cash! I was shocked. ! I have  joined  Jody in her ''hobby''.  Mitchell Wolf M.D.  Chicago  Illinois  ========================================================= ======= '' Not  being the gambling type  it took me several weeks to make up my  mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am  I decided  that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that  I  wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back''. '' I was  surprised  when I found my medium size post office box crammed with orders. I made  $319 210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is  that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't a better  investment  with a faster return and so big''.  Dan Sondstrom  Alberta  Canada  ========================================================= ======= '' I had  received this program before. I deleted it  but later I  wondered if I should have given it a try. Of course  I had no idea who  to contact ! to get another copy  so I had to wait until I was e-mailed  again by someone else.........11 months passed then it luckily came  again.....I did not delete this one! I made more than $490 000 on my  first try and all the money came within 22 weeks''.  Susan De Suza  New York  N.Y.  ========================================================= ======  '' It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with  little cost to you. I followed the simple instructions carefully and  within 10 days the money started to come in. My first month I made  $20 560.00 and by the end of third month my total cash count was $  362 840.00. Life is beautiful  Thanx to internet''.

Until recently, I was a final-year engineering student at the University of Sierra Leone in West Africa.  At the beginning of January last year, rebels in my country attacked our town and in one of the attacks they killed my parents. The main target was my late father, King Christopher George, who was the king of the city.  Luckily for me, I was at school when the attack took place. I also lost my only sister to the rebels. When I returned home to collect my parents' remains and after the burial, I discovered a document showing that my late father had deposited approximately US$6 million (Six million US dollars) with one of the private security companies here in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire. This money, according to the document, was intended for my late father to build an auto repair business for me once I graduated from college. After discovering this document, I traveled to Côte d'Ivoire to locate the security company in question and file a claim for the said money as my father's only living next of kin.  But I consciously decided to keep all my aunts and uncles away from this matter because none of them will be happy knowing that I have that kind of money. I managed to convince the people at the security company that I was the next of kin and that I now had all the related documents. I don't know what to do with it but I decided to contact you to ask you for help to take it out of the security company and transfer it to your account and also help me to come to your country to continue my studies and so that you will help me investing the money until I'm ready to start using it. I'm really desperate because I'm now alone in the world. Let me know what you want in compensation for helping me solve my problem. Most importantly, I strongly urge you to maintain a high level of secrecy and confidentiality in the entire matter. Please you can call me on 00225-075-03684.

This fund was created from collateral votes that were allocated to my client's portfolio during his tenure as chief security advisor to the then-president. What happened was that he transferred some of the funds from the vaults of the Central Bank of Nigeria to this security unit to purchase weapons and ammunition for the personal security unit of the then president. However, before the purchase was made, the president died. My client decided to keep it to himself because all his assets had been confiscated by the current regime.

"Date: Wednesday 4 September 2002 11:25:20 +0200 Content transfer encoding: 8bit Dear Partner, who will be first. I must apologize for using this medium to communicate with you about this project.  I am a high-ranking official of the Nigerian government and a founding member of the ruling party, currently the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).  My committee – the Niger Delta Development Corporation (NDDC) – which is responsible for managing and supervising the disbursement of oil revenues to the Nigerian government. The income under our control reaches several hundred million dollars a month. I and other colleagues from NDDC currently need a foreign partner to whose bank account we will transfer the amount of forty-nine million five hundred thousand US dollars ($49.5 million). This fund fell to us. as commission for crude oil sales contracts executed under our supervision.  The Fund is currently pending in a government account called CBN/FGN INDEPENDENT REVENUE number 400-939134 at J.P.MORGAN CHASE BANK New York. You can independently verify this. However, due to our position as civil servants and members of the NDDC, we cannot raise these funds on our behalf. This is because as top government officials we cannot currently legally hold or operate bank accounts outside our country.  I was delegated by my colleagues as part of the trust to look for a foreign partner to whose account we would transfer the funds. Hence the reason for this email. We will transfer the money to your account with your company when we present yours as a registered foreign company with a branch office in Nigeria and you are paid for the contract you have performed for our country through the NDDC and any other Federal Ministry that we decide to use to withdraw the funds.  For support and partnership, please reply to negotiate the fees or percentage you would like to receive once the funds arrive in your bank account.  However, please note that this transaction regarding our instructions to continue our relationship is subject to these terms and conditions. First, our belief in your transparency. Second, treat this transaction with the utmost secrecy and confidentiality. Finally, and most importantly, you will be provided with an account that you have complete control over.  The transaction, though discreet, is legal and does not involve any risk or legal drawback for either us or you, now or in the future, as we have introduced excellent machines that will ensure hassle-free transfer to your account once approved.  The transfer will be made to your account within ten-fourteen (10-14) business days, once we have reached an agreement and you have provided me with the appropriate bank account and company name and address with all contact numbers, including fax number.  I look forward to working with you and ask that you maintain confidentiality in this transaction. Please send me your reply by mail.  Sincerely, Anderson K. Eseimoku",1

That's a savings of $280, and the only difference is that you don't have the colorful box and instructions - which aren't very useful.

I'm sorry this post will surprise you even though we don't know. Due to the current war on white farmers in Zimbabwe and President Robert Mugabe's support to demand that all white owned farms in our country be favorably re-elected.  All white farmers were asked to hand over their farms to the government for redistribution and indeed to members of his political party and my father, although the black was the treasurer of the farmers' association and a strong member of the opposition party that did not support President Idea. He then ordered members of his party and the police under his pay to invade my father's farm and burn everything on the farm. They killed my Father and took many things from his farm. After my father died, our local pastor and a close friend of my father gave us his will documents with my father's instructions that we should leave Zimbabwe in case something happened to him. Will documents have a deposit certificate confirming the deposit. Kept for us by an unknown security company. To the company that its contents are money, therefore it was deposited as personal effects and ensures that we do not stay here as we could be easily found. by his enemies. The total amount is USD 21.5 million. We are therefore asking for your help to transfer the fund out of Zimbabwe as our fate and future are far from reality, hence this email to you. The president's current ban on the international press in Zimbabwe and his resignation as Minister of Finance to avoid issuing transfer permits in excess of $1 million to white farmers are just a few of the unthinkable things he is committing in my country. I tried to contact my father's close friend, Mr. John Casahans from Australia, also a farmer who was traveling with us to Zimbabwe but left with his family late last year after this unpleasant incident, to no avail. If you are interested in helping, please contact me immediately via email to facilitate communication and I will provide you with the time frame and terms of the transaction. We have come up with a great plan to take care of your transfer within two weeks. Please note that this transaction is 100% confidential and risk-free and poses no risk to you or us in any way. We have decided to give you 20% of the total amount after confirming the fund in any account of your choice, in case taxation will not require much use of the money, and we look forward to coming to your country to invest our share and settle there. I will provide you with a private telephone number so that our conversation is 100% confidential.  NOTE: REPLY TO bulmulete@golfemail.com God bless you as you help yourself and us.

Duba, son of MR. Theo Duba from Zimbabwe. I got your address from the South African Information Exchange in Johannesburg. .  Due to the previous war against white farmers in Zimbabwe by PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE and his supporters to take over all white owned farms in our country, he ordered all white owned farmers to surrender all their farms to his party members and his supporters. My father was a victim of this oppression and inhuman behavior because he was one of the richest farmers in our country, my father was completely against President MUGABE's bill. The president's supporters invaded my father's farm, burned everything on the farm, arrested him and confiscated all of his investment.  Early last year, when this victimization of white farmers by President Mugabe began, my late father predicted a worse situation. He arranged almost all of his money, hid it in a box and smuggled it out of Zimbabwe through diplomatic channels to South Africa. When he arrived in South Africa, he deposited the box with a private security company, with the help of his lawyer here in South Africa, without revealing the true contents of the box to the security company, and then returned home. He registered the box as a family treasure.  While he was still in detention, which ended in his death by torture, he referred me to his lawyer in South Africa due to the escalating crisis in Zimbabwe. He didn't want my life to be in danger. He was arrested on March 5 last year. Sadly my dear father passed away on December 10, 2001. I arrived in South Africa in March 2002. Now my stay here in Africa is frustrating and depressing as my father's lawyer is currently hospitalized in London with terrible heart problems; although I have the location documents with me, I want to move to your country permanently. Currently, my residence permit here in South Africa is an asylum permit as a refugee.  I am asking for help to transfer money from a security company ($15 million) from this country to your country for investment. If you think you can help me, please try to contact me immediately using the number below. Your compensation/share for assistance will be negotiated if you are willing to help me. As the problem still persists in my country, please try to keep this information private and secret as I would not want anything that would expose me and the existence of this money.  Your urgent reply will be highly appreciated.  Best regards, STEVEN DUBA (DR).  TEL: 27-83-713-2696 ________________________________________________________________ Does Yahoo!? Peasant!

I am touched to be able to write this letter to you.   This was confidential given my current circumstances and situation. I fled with my husband and our two sons James Kongolo and Nzanga from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, where my family settled and later moved to Morocco, where my husband later died of cancer. However, due to this situation, we have decided to convert most of my husband's billions of dollars deposited in a Swiss bank and other countries into other forms of money encoded for a safe purpose, since the new head of state (Dr.) Laurent Kabila has reached an agreement with the Swiss government and other European countries to freeze all my late husband's treasures deposited in some European countries.   Therefore, my children and I decided to stay in Africa to investigate the situation until things improve. Like now, when President Kabila is dead and his son (Joseph Kabila) takes over. One of my late husband's castles in southern France was confiscated by the French government and I had to change my identity to prevent my investment from being found and confiscated. I have deposited the amount of eighteen million US dollars (18,000,000 US dollars) 00.) with a security company for safe keeping. I want you to express your interest in helping us receive the money on our behalf so that we can introduce you to my son (Kongolo) who knows how to apply for said funds. I want you to help invest this money, but I don't want my identity revealed. I also want to acquire real estate/land and shares in international companies and engage in other safe and non-speculative investments as you advise me. I would like to emphasize here the high level of confidentiality that the upcoming project requires, and I hope that you will not betray the trust I have in you. In summary, if you want to help us, my son (Kongolo) will reveal all information to you regarding this project, we will let you know where the funds are currently held, and we will also discuss the compensation for your services. For this reason, we kindly ask you to provide us with your contact details, i.e. your personal telephone and fax number for verification purposes, and confirm receipt of this message using the above e-mail address.

FT.) installed, meeting all codes and sprays used. Many companies we talk to have a product that seems great BUT they haven't spent the money testing the foam. Perhaps a small committee could assess the performance of various products and report the results to the SPFA, which would in turn ""raise funding"" from the US.   #136-2 William B Australia We are in Australia but are having a hard time locating polyurea sprayers here so we can start the PDA chapter. Do you have any list of Australian contractors/suppliers????or perhaps they can raise their hand and let us know at enviroline@powerup.com.au for the good of the game it is imperative that the association informs customers and specifiers of applications and properties polyureas and trained its members also to keep away the cowboys who are giving the industry a bad name   #136-3 Ed M. I am an aviation magazine writer and one of them is new Test International publication, which was released this month. I need any new processes that can be applied to aircraft, especially commercial aviation.  #136-4 John C Louisiana I have a Graco Foam Cat 2000 and a Probler gun with a 01 tip.  I use this setup to spray truck bed liners.  My question is: Can and how can I spray foam insulation with my equipment?  What are the different types of insulation?   #136-5 Murph Mahaffey Glas-Craft I like the new look of the Industry Forum!   #136-6 Mark W South Carolina I'm tired of all this nonsense about covering foam with a ""thermal barrier"". What the hell do you think a marshmallow is? If you're saying that anything that can be FORCED to burn should be covered with a FIRE RESISTANT barrier, then you better start covering all those trusses, joists and plywood that are definitely NOT first class fire rated. This double standard regarding foam comes directly from those who stand to lose business from it. Icynene is DIFFERENT.  DOES NOT BURN ALONE. IT DOES NOT MELT. DOES NOT EMIT PHOSGENE. Does it smoke during a fire? Sure, so what? Blaming the foam in the attic for a house fire because it causes the foam to ultimately burn is as foolish as blaming the foam seat cushions for catching fire when the gas tank bursts and burns the car. Get real inspectors. You want us to cover the only thing in the attic that DOESN'T BURN!  As for the infamous R rating system, THIS IS COMPLETELY FALSE. The test is designed to make porous insulation appear to perform better than it actually does.  By only measuring conductivity and ignoring convection and radiant transfer to convection, the test should be thrown out for the industry lackey, and that was 20 years ago with that outdated fiberglass junk that everyone is still selling.  There's a reason they don't make refrigerators, freezers, coolers, and coffee cups out of fiberglass or cellulose.   Think about it.   #136-7 Dirk Benthien Forum Moderator Thank you to Marek and Dik for the above comments. I also feel that far too often individuals and companies become complacent and quietly live by the rules and regulations without trying to change them – even when everyone knows they make no sense. We are all experts and representatives of this industry and we should speak up and promote change!   #136-8 Martin S Canada Does anyone make a machine that dispenses a crumb rubber/urethane blend?    #136-9 Carole L California re #135-8 Otto V Germany What are the answers? (Recall 141b)   #136-10 Brian D Canada     There is a lot of talk about ceramic coatings.  We are a distributor of such a coating.  We have never subscribed to R-20.  Reason = ASTM test is not available to measure the R-value of coatings. We compare standard insulation to ceramic coatings using BTU loss calculations.  Depending on your criteria, we can get anywhere from 2 to 3 inches of standard aluminum jacketed insulation.  We have the data and projects to prove it.   #136-11 CPI We have had inquiries from many people regarding used equipment - particularly the Gusmer H20/35 H2000 H2 GX-7 and Glas-Craft Probler.

"Date: Sun 08 Sep 2002 15:29:20 +0200 (CEST) From: =?iso-8859-1?q?ackou=20acke=20martin=20francis?= Subject: I NEED URGENT HELP POSSIBLE.TEL:+ 225 05775748 To: zzzz@jmason.org Version MIME: 1.0 Content Type: Text/Plain; charset=iso-8859-1 Content transfer encoding: 8-bit MR MARTIN FRANCIS ABIDJAN COTE DIVOIRE WEST AFRICA TEL: +225 05775748. URGENT AND NOBLE PROPOSAL FOR A DIRECTOR. DEAR, I would like to warmly greet you and your entire family. I received your contact from the Ivory Coast Chamber of Commerce. I prayed about it and chose your name over others because of its respectful nature. Moreover, after my strong prayers and fasting, God reveals to me that you are a straightforward, honest and Godly person. This is the reason why I never waste my time to offer you this business for our mutual benefits. In fact, you will never regret it, as long as you give me the best possible hand to work with. Believe me.  My name is MARTIN FRANCIS, citizen of the coast divoire and only child of the late Mr. and Mrs. FRANCIS. My late father was a former financial controller of a telecommunications company in Côte d'Ivoire (CITELCOM). My father died in recent years due to the heated political crisis in my country. But I am motherless because my fathers were late and my mother's death on SEPTEMBER 26, 1993 was the result of a spiritual attack by a member of our family who hated her only because of my father's wealth. Moreover, they also tried their part against my father and me, but negatively because God Almighty is on our side. Indeed, God is wonderful. Although before my father's death in one of the private hospitals here, he secretly revealed to me specifically family matters and above all the safety of his money, 16,500,000.00 dollars (sixteen million five hundred thousand US dollars) that he deposited in a bank here in my Abidjan county Cte dIvoire and I used my surname MARTIN FRANCIS as the closest relative of the deposits. This amount came from an inflated contract for the construction of an underground telephone network to replace the previous one in the new city (Yamoussoukro) and other large cities, as well as for the installation of a microwave station, awarded to my late father, Mr. JOSEPH FRANCIS in 1999 to expatriate companies. In fact, after completing the payment of the contract workers, my late father deposited this fund in the bank as the full executor-beneficiary of the said company (CITELCOM). This is a fund that I want to transfer to your account as a contractor-beneficiary due for payment provided that you cooperate. Therefore, I am appealing to you for your full and urgent assistance in telegraphic transfer of these sixteen million five hundred thousand US dollars, 16,500,000 dollars US to the account of your choice to ensure a very good business investment in your country as instructed by my father before he was late. I require the following from you.  1. Your personal phone and fax number for easy and close communication 2. Your bank number to efficiently and effectively transfer this money to your designated account 3. You must make the necessary arrangements for me to meet you immediately after the funds are transferred to your account and confirmed by you. 4.You must provide me with a college in your country to continue my education.  5. You will have to be my guardian and part of the joint venture investment when I reach your country.  In addition, my late father instructed me to donate 20% of the total amount to someone to help me pass on this fund.  Furthermore, I would like to assure you that this transaction will be finalized within the next (3) days in which you express your willingness to assist me. I suggest that this transaction be conducted in strict confidence because I have worked out all the conditions regarding the transfer of this fund.  I request and kindly request you to expedite this transaction as soon as possible as my late father instructed me not to invest this money in this country, Cote d'Ivoire. That I should invest abroad as per my choice for my own benefit and security reasons.  Thank you very much while waiting for confirmation of this business proposal and please do not hesitate to contact me immediately after receiving this message with my direct phone number mentioned above tel: +225 05775748 so that we can proceed immediately. Please and please don't disappoint.  I am waiting for your urgent answer, thank you very much again and God bless you.  Best regards, MARTIN FRANCIS.         ____________________________________________________________ Is Yahoo!? -- Une adresse @yahoo.fr is free and en franais ! Peasant!

(v1.52f) Business Importance: Normal Content Transfer Encoding: 8 bit It was the spring of 1979. I was a tall, goofy-looking kid in middle school with buck teeth and freckles.  Every day in the cafeteria I went from table to table... I stole other children's lunch money.  No, I didn't rob them with a gun or a knife - I just made a little deal with them.  “I'll borrow two dollars today,” I said, “and I'll bring you five dollars next week.”  The investment was too good to pass up, and the other kids were throwing their lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes.  Of course, when ""next week"" rolled around and I couldn't come up with the cash, I promised I would pay them even more the following week if they would let me hold on to my investment a little longer.  Finally, the end of the year came and high school began, and with it came girls and homework and parties and sports, and these poor eighth-grade kids had more on their minds than last year's lunch money.  I escaped with a decent sum of money for a high school student and they didn't even beat me up.  This story contains two of the greatest stock market secrets you will ever know.  First, greed is your number one enemy. You won't turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out when you get ahead.  Don't wait until the boat sinks before grabbing a life jacket.  Second, never trust any investment advisor. They count on their money, not yours.  The ""professionals"", those rigid investment advisors and money managers, will always tell you that the best time to buy is NOW.  According to these guys, the longer you keep your money in the market, the more money you will make. Ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is “NEVER.”    In a sense they are right.  If you put $250,000 in an index fund now, you'll probably have over a million dollars in thirty or forty years.  But here's the problem: do you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich?  Hell no!  You want your money NOW – so you can enjoy it. It's hard to enjoy your assets when you're seventy and in a wheelchair.  If you could make a million dollars in the next few years, what would you do with it?  Where would you travel?  What car would you buy?    The fact is... youth is the best time to be rich.  If your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatility is your ally and stability is your enemy.  You want to see these big two-hundred-point gains a day and then a week later a four-hundred-point crash.  You don't care if the market is up 20% this year, as long as it was UNSTABLE.  This way you will earn money.  I'm talking about day trading here.    My father invests in the traditional way; it has good shares and is going up by 30 thousand. and drops by 30 thousand. In the long run, 5-10 years, it makes money.   A day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of XYZ for a profit of $25,000 in a 5-10 minute trade.  It works quickly, using all available information about a specific stock and assessing whether it will rise or fall in a matter of hours or sometimes minutes.    I can teach you how to do it and how to make amazing amounts of money doing it.  It's not rocket science and you just need to learn a few basic principles to get started.  Society would have you believe that successful trading is complicated and requires formal training.    The truth is that rich people use very simple investment strategies to make money.    Popular media and investment professionals portray successful trading as difficult and complex in order to scare you out of the boxing ring.  They don't want competition, and they certainly don't want you paying a few dollars to an online trading company to complete a transaction that would cost them forty or fifty dollars.  They only make money if you believe two lies: 1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average person.  2) Using an investment advisor who charges a high commission is safer than investing online for a few dollars per trade.  Here's what the financial gurus in today's society absolutely DON'T WANT YOU TO KNOW... Profitable day trading strategies are actually so simple that anyone can do it - as long as they put in a few hours to learn.    After reading over 200 financial books and publications over the last decade and using day trading to make over four million dollars in the stock market, I have come to the following conclusions: **Achieving financial success is incredibly simple.  **Anyone can do it.  **Learning only takes a few hours.  When I discovered the secret of day trading, I didn't become rich overnight.  If you want an instant cash transfer to Wal-Mart.  Buy a ski mask and a shotgun and rob the local bank. The only way to get rich quickly or otherwise is through hard work, knowledge and determination.  After learning the basics of day trading, I started practicing the art of trading itself and the first few weeks brought modest profits.  The next few months gave me the hands-on experience I needed to really make a living, and I was approaching a six-figure income. In less than three years, with no formal financial education, with minimal effort and moderate risk, I made my first million.  I want to share the knowledge I gained during these creative years of trading with you in my new book Master Trader.  You will learn from my mistakes and successes as I teach you the simple, secret day trading formula that I have used profitably year after year.  A day trader's earnings can be astonishing.  Thousands or even hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost in a matter of minutes.  The difference between making money and losing your shirt is simply this: knowledge.  I will pass on this knowledge to you and give you an edge in this high stakes game.   Average day trader income: 5% average income over $500,000 per year 22% average income over $250,000 per year 35% average income over $100,000 per year.  27% average income from $50,000 to $99,999 per year 11% average income from $20,000 to $49,999 per year After reading Master Trader, you will discover extremely profitable, simple yet powerful trading methods that will give you an almost unfair trading advantage and will make you win DESPITE the current market weakness.   Here's an excerpt of what I'll teach you: ***Make money whether stocks go up or down.   ***Learn how to get in and out of stocks in a split second.   *** Find out exactly what stocks to trade, the exact price to buy them and the exact price to sell them.    *** Save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid beginner mistakes.   *** Learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to consistently make money in any market!    *** Learn proven strategies that give you the best chance for great success.    *** Profit from large price fluctuations during the day.   ***Earn money on the biggest news.   *** Actively manage risk and learn to achieve maximum profits.    ***Learn how to use the tools and information that Wall Street professionals use.   *** Learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind.    It's time to ask yourself: “Will I listen to professionals who say BUY, BUY, BUY, but never sell? Or maybe I will take control of my financial future and start making money in the stock market NOW?”  Who cares about your economic interests - some wealthy Wall Street stockbroker or you?  With the Master Trader e-book, you will learn everything you need to know to start your Day Trading adventure... from choosing the best broker to take advantage of the lowest commissions and instant order execution, to professional trading strategies that make professional traders millions of dollars.  The Master Trader eBook is the most comprehensive, yet easy to understand and simple book ever written on active trading. If you are serious about success in short-term stock trading - ORDER TODAY and start paving the way to your own financial future.  Oh, and remember that skinny kid in eighth grade? His high school friends laughed when he said he was going to make money in the stock market.    Six years later, he bought a beach house on the California coast - FOR CASH.  Oops, they weren't laughing anymore.  In the rollercoaster market we have today, day trading is the fastest path to wealth.  If you're looking for a long-term retirement investment without the risk growing at 5% per year, this is definitely not the game for you.  However, if you want the FASTEST possible way to make a fortune in the market with the lowest risk, order the MASTER TRADER e-book now.  I promise to teach you ALL the secrets that helped me become a millionaire through successful day trading.  You don't need to know anything about the market and anyone can do it with minimal effort.

I was just a tall, goofy-looking kid in middle school with buck teeth and freckles.  Every day in the cafeteria I went from table to table... I stole other children's lunch money.  No, I didn't rob them with a gun or a knife - I just made a little deal with them.  “I'll borrow two dollars today,” I said, “and I'll bring you five dollars next week.”  The investment was too good to pass up, and the other kids were throwing their lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes.  Of course, when ""next week"" rolled around and I couldn't come up with the cash, I promised I would pay them even more the following week if they would let me hold on to my investment a little longer.  Finally, the end of the year came and high school began, and with it came girls and homework and parties and sports, and these poor eighth-grade kids had more on their minds than last year's lunch money.  I escaped with a decent sum of money for a high school student and they didn't even beat me up.  This story contains two of the greatest stock market secrets you will ever know.  First, greed is your number one enemy. You won't turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out when you get ahead.  Don't wait until the boat sinks before grabbing a life jacket.  Second, never trust any investment advisor. They count on their money, not yours.  The ""professionals"", those rigid investment advisors and money managers, will always tell you that the best time to buy is NOW.  According to these guys, the longer you keep your money in the market, the more money you will make. Ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is “NEVER.”    In a sense they are right.  If you put $250,000 in an index fund now, you'll probably have over a million dollars in thirty or forty years.  But here's the problem: do you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich?  Hell no!  You want your money NOW – so you can enjoy it. It's hard to enjoy your assets when you're seventy and in a wheelchair.  If you could make a million dollars in the next few years, what would you do with it?  Where would you travel?  What car would you buy?    The fact is... youth is the best time to be rich.  If your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatility is your ally and stability is your enemy.  You want to see these big two-hundred-point gains a day and then a week later a four-hundred-point crash.  You don't care if the market is up 20% this year, as long as it was UNSTABLE.  This way you will earn money.  I'm talking about day trading here.    My father invests in the traditional way; it has good shares and is going up by 30 thousand. and drops by 30 thousand. In the long run, 5-10 years, it makes money.   A day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of XYZ for a profit of $25,000 in a 5-10 minute trade.  It works quickly, using all available information about a specific stock and assessing whether it will rise or fall in a matter of hours or sometimes minutes.    I can teach you how to do it and how to make amazing amounts of money doing it.  It's not rocket science and you just need to learn a few basic principles to get started.  Society would have you believe that successful trading is complicated and requires formal training.    The truth is that rich people use very simple investment strategies to make money.    Popular media and investment professionals portray successful trading as difficult and complex in order to scare you out of the boxing ring.  They don't want competition, and they certainly don't want you paying a few dollars to an online trading company to complete a transaction that would cost them forty or fifty dollars.  They only make money if you believe two lies: 1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average person.  2) Using an investment advisor who charges a high commission is safer than investing online for a few dollars per trade.  Here's what the financial gurus in today's society absolutely DON'T WANT YOU TO KNOW... Profitable day trading strategies are actually so simple that anyone can do it - as long as they put in a few hours to learn.    After reading over 200 financial books and publications over the last decade and using day trading to make over four million dollars in the stock market, I have come to the following conclusions: **Achieving financial success is incredibly simple.  **Anyone can do it.  **Learning only takes a few hours.  When I discovered the secret of day trading, I didn't become rich overnight.  If you want an instant cash transfer to Wal-Mart.  Buy a ski mask and a shotgun and rob the local bank. The only way to get rich quickly or otherwise is through hard work, knowledge and determination.  After learning the basics of day trading, I started practicing the art of trading itself and the first few weeks brought modest profits.  The next few months gave me the hands-on experience I needed to really make a living, and I was approaching a six-figure income. In less than three years, with no formal financial education, with minimal effort and moderate risk, I made my first million.  I want to share the knowledge I gained during these creative years of trading with you in my new book Master Trader.  You will learn from my mistakes and successes as I teach you the simple, secret day trading formula that I have used profitably year after year.  A day trader's earnings can be astonishing.  Thousands or even hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost in a matter of minutes.  The difference between making money and losing your shirt is simply this: knowledge.  I will pass on this knowledge to you and give you an edge in this high stakes game.   Average day trader income: 5% average income over $500,000 per year 22% average income over $250,000 per year 35% average income over $100,000 per year.  27% average income from $50,000 to $99,999 per year 11% average income from $20,000 to $49,999 per year After reading Master Trader, you will discover extremely profitable, simple yet powerful trading methods that will give you an almost unfair trading advantage and will make you win DESPITE the current market weakness.   Here's an excerpt of what I'll teach you: ***Make money whether stocks go up or down.   ***Learn how to get in and out of stocks in a split second.   *** Find out exactly what stocks to trade, the exact price to buy them and the exact price to sell them.    *** Save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid beginner mistakes.   *** Learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to consistently make money in any market!    *** Learn proven strategies that give you the best chance for great success.    *** Profit from large price fluctuations during the day.   ***Earn money on the biggest news.   *** Actively manage risk and learn to achieve maximum profits.    ***Learn how to use the tools and information that Wall Street professionals use.   *** Learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind.    It's time to ask yourself: “Will I listen to professionals who say BUY, BUY, BUY, but never sell? Or maybe I will take control of my financial future and start making money in the stock market NOW?”  Who cares about your economic interests - some wealthy Wall Street stockbroker or you?  With the Master Trader e-book, you will learn everything you need to know to start your Day Trading adventure... from choosing the best broker to take advantage of the lowest commissions and instant order execution, to professional trading strategies that make professional traders millions of dollars.  The Master Trader eBook is the most comprehensive, yet easy to understand and simple book ever written on active trading. If you are serious about success in short-term stock trading - ORDER TODAY and start paving the way to your own financial future.  Oh, and remember that skinny kid in eighth grade? His high school friends laughed when he said he was going to make money in the stock market.    Six years later, he bought a beach house on the California coast - FOR CASH.  Oops, they weren't laughing anymore.  In the rollercoaster market we have today, day trading is the fastest path to wealth.  If you're looking for a long-term retirement investment without the risk growing at 5% per year, this is definitely not the game for you.  However, if you want the FASTEST possible way to make a fortune in the market with the lowest risk, order the MASTER TRADER e-book now.  I promise to teach you ALL the secrets that helped me become a millionaire through successful day trading.  You don't need to know anything about the market and anyone can do it with minimal effort.

I'm sorry this email will surprise you, even though we don't know my mother. Mrs. Clara. You found the contact through her private search. Due to the current war against white farmers in Zimbabwe and President Robert Mugabe's support to curry favor with all white owned farms in our country in order to gain favor for re-election.  All white farmers were asked to hand over their farms to the government for redistribution and indeed to members of his political party and my father, although the black was the treasurer of the farmers' association and a strong member of the opposition party that did not support President Idea. He then ordered members of his party and the police under his pay to invade my father's farm and burn everything on the farm. They killed my Father and took many things from his farm. After my father died, our local pastor and a close friend of my father gave us his will documents with my father's instructions that we should leave Zimbabwe in case something happened to him. Will documents have a deposit certificate confirming the deposit. Kept for us by an unknown security company. To the company that its contents are money, therefore it was deposited as personal effects and ensures that we do not stay here as we could be easily found. by his enemies. The total amount is USD 21.5 million. We are therefore asking for your help to transfer the fund out of Zimbabwe as our fate and future are far from reality, hence this email to you. The president's current ban on the international press in Zimbabwe and his resignation as Minister of Finance to avoid issuing transfer permits in excess of $1 million to white farmers are just a few of the unthinkable things he is committing in my country. I tried to contact my father's close friend, Mr. John Casahans from Australia, also a farmer who was traveling with us to Zimbabwe but left with his family late last year after this unpleasant incident, to no avail. If you are interested in helping, please contact me immediately via email to facilitate communication and I will provide you with the time frame and terms of the transaction. We have come up with a great plan to take care of your transfer within two weeks. Please note that this transaction is 100% confidential and risk-free and poses no risk to you or us in any way. We have decided to give you 20% of the total amount after confirming the fund in any account of your choice, in case taxation will not require much use of the money, and we look forward to coming to your country to invest our share and settle there. I will provide you with a private telephone number so that our conversation is 100% confidential.  Please do not use the reply button, only reply to Edmulete7@netscape.net. Please pay attention.  May God truly bless you as you help yourself and us.

I am a high-ranking official of the Nigerian government and a founding member of the ruling party, currently the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).  My committee – the Niger Delta Development Corporation (NDDC) – which is responsible for managing and supervising the disbursement of oil revenues to the Nigerian government. The income under our control reaches several hundred million dollars a month. I and other colleagues from NDDC currently need a foreign partner to whose bank account we will transfer the amount of forty-nine million five hundred thousand US dollars ($49.5 million). This fund fell to us. as commission for crude oil sales contracts executed under our supervision.  The Fund is currently pending in a government account called CBN/FGN INDEPENDENT REVENUE number 400-939134 at J.P.MORGAN CHASE BANK New York. You can do this independently. However, due to our position as civil servants and members of the NDDC, we cannot raise these funds on our behalf. This is because as top government officials we cannot currently legally hold or operate bank accounts outside our country.  I was delegated by my colleagues as part of the trust to look for a foreign partner to whose account we would transfer the funds. Hence the reason for this email. We will transfer the money to your account with your company when we present yours as a registered foreign company in Nigeria and you have received payment for the contract you have performed for our country through the NDDC and any other Federal Ministry through which we choose to use to withdraw funds.  For support and partnership, please reply to negotiate the fees or percentage you would like to receive once the funds arrive in your bank account.  However, please note that this transaction regarding our instructions to continue our relationship is subject to these terms and conditions. First, our belief in your transparency. Second, treat this transaction with the utmost secrecy and confidentiality. Finally, and most importantly, you will be provided with an account that you have complete control over.  The transaction, though discreet, is legal and does not involve any risk or legal drawback for either us or you, now or in the future, as we have introduced excellent machines that will ensure hassle-free transfer to your account once approved.  The transfer will be made to your account within ten-fourteen (10-14) business days, once we have reached an agreement and you have provided me with the appropriate bank account and company name and address with all contact numbers, including fax number.  I look forward to working with you and ask that you maintain confidentiality in this transaction. Please send me your reply by mail.  Best regards, Anderson K.

We help individuals unlock cash from unused assets.  Typical candidates are individuals who are typically 65 years of age or older and find that their financial and/or estate planning needs have changed. Financial advisors have advised some candidates to us to cancel their life insurance policies so that they can invest their money in a vehicle that will now give them a return. DON'T cancel your policy because it could be worth it NOW.  Why do people sell their policies?  The reasons why people decide to sell their life insurance policies are as varied as the people themselves. Some reasons include: Pay off debt Long-term care insurance fund Eliminate costly premiums Take advantage of other financial options Donate to charity Help family members Life partners Living Solutions Traditionally, life insurance provides benefits only after death. With Life Partners, you can provide cash benefits for life!     Life Partners Goals To provide market ratings to life insurance policyholders Provide quotes for qualified policies Provide lump sum cash payments to qualified owners Eliminate costly premium payments Contact us now for a FREE quote on your life insurance policy.

Venture Reporter 307 West 36th Street 10th Floor New York New York 10018 Phone: 646.473.2222 Online content company.                                Dear Friends The online content industry is doing fantastically well.      Sounds crazy? Maybe.  Due to the continued disregard for advertising on the Internet over the past two years, content websites have resorted to laying off employees and discontinuing their offerings.      But this terrible environment has spawned an undeniable trend: content companies requiring people to pay for content.  Finally, after five years of freedom, people are starting to understand that on the Internet, just like in the real world, you get what you pay for, and they are taking out their credit cards.  According to the Online Publishers Association, U.S. consumers spent $675 million on paid content online last year, a 92% increase in spending compared to spending levels in 2000. This number is expected to increase exponentially this year.  Take a look at these success stories: New York Times Digital has steadily expanded its paid content services over the past year and saw a 16 percent increase in its total revenue in the most recent quarter.                  TheStreet.com brought in more than $3 million in subscriptions last quarter, up nearly 50 percent from the year-ago quarter.                  By the end of this year, ConsumerReports.com will reach more than one million paying subscribers.                  Consumer media subscription service RealNetworks has more than 750,000 subscribers, which brought in $17.8 million in the most recent quarter.                  The Wall Street Journal Online added more than 6,000 new paying customers last quarter, increasing its subscriber base to 646,000. FT.com added 17,000 subscribers in the three months after launching its premium site in May.            In recognition of this trend, we are hosting the third installment of our innovative Content Management Summit on October 10, 2002. This event highlights the shift in the content industry from free to paid subscription services and the technologies that enable content management and monetization.      Our previous Content Management Summit (also known as the Digital Rights Summit), held on October 18 last year in New York and January 29 in Los Angeles, was an unqualified success.      The 3rd Content Management Summit, taking place on October 10, 2002 in New York City at Millennium Broadway, will bring together 100 executives from leading content and distribution companies for a day of networking and discovering practical solutions.      The event will include presentations by software and service companies providing services and solutions in the field of sales, distribution, management and content protection.      We are excited that Microsoft TeleKnowledge eMeta and Liquify will be showcasing their latest products and services.      The event will also feature six intimate roundtables focusing on various aspects of online content.  These panels are intended to provide an informal forum to discuss the challenges facing these specific vertical markets, changes in the sectors since the collapse of the internet industry, and best practices in the industry.  The panels will feature leading practitioners from each sector and will also include an interactive Q&A session with the audience.      The roundtable topics will include: Online blogs: their impact on large media companies in terms of editorial as well as content delivery/production mechanisms.                  Financial news and information companies: How they use technology to deliver content to users and how the economics have changed since the stock market crash.                  Business information services like Hoovers Lexis-Nexis and others: best practices for marketing niche products and industry revenue streams.                  Daily news/newspaper publishers publishing online: including how speed dictates technology choices and the shift towards paid content and its implications.                  Consumer and entertainment publishers: How publishers determine the value of entertainment content, the emphasis on paid subscriptions, online advertising and other issues.            We invite you to this very important event on October 10.  If you are directly responsible for managing content on a large content site, you may qualify for a VIP ticket.  Please email your request with your name and biography to invitation@cmsummit.com.

My Dear Good morning. This very confidential request should come as a surprise to you. However, due to the nature of what is happening to me and my family, I have insisted that I contact you and I fully understand that this is not the best way to contact you due to the nature of my request and the attention it requires. I received your contact details from your country's information directory while desperately searching for someone who could secretly and confidentially help me move and manage some family fortunes.  My name is Mr Michael Kamah, second son of Mr Smith Kamah from Beitbridge Zimbabwe. At the height of the current political crisis in our country, during which white farmers in our country are being killed and robbed of their belongings by supporters of our president, Mr. Robert G. Mugabe, in his efforts to reclaim all white-owned farms in our country, my father and my older brother were brutally murdered to a painful death on February 13, 2002 in their fight to protect several white farmers who had fled to take shelter in our home. My father during his time on earth was a prominent businessman dealing in diamonds and gold from some foreign countries. He publicly opposes the oil politics and crimes against humanity against white farmers carried out by Robert Mugabe and his supporters, in which they imposed media law restrictions to protect their evil deeds. It was not enough that the president and his supporters, after winning the last undemocratic elections, decided to block and! confiscate all the accounts and assets of our black natives [including my father's assets and accounts] who oppose his policies and provide support to these white farmers, along with the assets of the white farmers themselves that are currently being confiscated. That's why I decided to move my mother and younger sister to South Africa, where we currently live with nothing and no means of subsistence.  During my father's earthly life, he deposited the sum of eight million six hundred thousand United States dollars [US$8,600,000.00] in a cargo box with a financial and security company in the Republic of Togo in exchange for cash and transportation of diamonds and gold with several foreign business clients waiting to instructions for transfer to his destination, which he never followed before he met his untimely death on that faithful day. With this in mind, and as my father's only surviving son, and in light of the current killing bans and confiscation of his property, as one of those who provide support to white farmers in our country, I humbly wish to inform you of my intention to use your name and address to ensure that this fund is withdrawn from Africa to the European office of this financial company and I am also asking for honest and trustworthy assistance to help me clear and place this money there before it is imposed and blocked by the current Mugabe!  regime. My mother currently has a valid document confirming this deposit.  This is what I want you to do for me;  1. I want you to be introduced to the financial and security company as the person I have contacted to help my family for this purpose, under whose name and address I and my mother will give them its office in the Republic of Togo as the person who will settle this money when they transfer it to their office in Europe. 2. To finally help me develop and manage this money in any profitable business in your country for at least three years.   I hope that you will honor this request and consider it with favor and great understanding of our current situation, and that you will be a very honest and trustworthy person. Also keeping in mind the confidential nature of my request, I emphasize that you keep everything to yourself to protect the future of my family and yourself by providing this assistance. Thank you and I look forward to your urgent response as soon as you read this request.  Best regards, Mr. Michael Kamah and family.           -- Irish Linux Users Group: ilug@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for information about (un)subscriptions.

WILLIAMS FALANA (SAN) Sir, I am an attorney at Williams Falana and a member of the Nigeria Bar Association (NBA). Your contact came to me via the World Business Encyclopedia. Therefore, I have decided to introduce this company to you in confidence for the mutual benefit of both of us.   An amount of 48 million dollars (forty-eight million United States) was deposited with a security company here in the country by the late Head of State (GEN.SANI ABACHA) for safekeeping. This money was deposited in secure vaults/boxes and marked as personal effects, so the security company does not know the true contents of the boxes. The money was originally intended to be used for his political campaign.  Since I was his family representative, he confided in me the relevant documents regarding this deposit before he died of cardiac arrest.  In fact, we have made arrangements with the foreign security company to transfer this money via diplomatic shipment to its offshore branch, where you will be required to claim the shipment as the true beneficiary of the shipment. You should know that this business is safe and 100% risk-free as it does not involve drug money or terrorist funds.   If you are interested in doing this transaction with me, 20% will be for you for your help, 5% for general expenses and 75% for us.  You are required to promptly email your full name and address, which I will use to create an agreement that will guide and protect both of us in this transaction, and which will also be used to change ownership of the shipment to your name as the beneficiary of the shipment.  Please also send me phone and fax numbers to facilitate communication. When you express your desire to me by sending the above requirement. The transaction will be completed within 7 (seven) business days.  I will be waiting for your urgent reply. You can contact me on my mobile number: 234-80-33055024 or alternative email address: williamsfalana@caramail.com Best regards, Barrister Williams Falana {SAN} ________________________________________ Bo=EEte aux lettres - Caramail - http://www .caramail.com --=_NextPart_Caramail_0054031032174770_ID--",1

What is ""Ghetto"" in America? I'm glad you asked. Before I go further, I warn you that this explanation may not suit many of you, but it is no less true! The ""ghetto"" in America is a society of individuals composed primarily of African Americans who represent the impoverished and often unpolished side of ""Black America"";  Confused?! I will explain further; Have you ever passed a typical ghetto community; namely ""projects"" and I noticed an unusual number of fancy cars parked in this particular area and wondered how this was possible? Or maybe you were at the mall and noticed an unusual number of young, ""teenage-looking"" black women carrying babies or pushing strollers, often with a toddler on their back! You may also have noticed that they were rarely accompanied by a male companion. If you paid close attention, you may also have noticed the all-important “wedding ring” missing from your ring finger!” And of course we have all heard the stories of young black men carrying guns and knives, allegedly committing robberies and stealing cars from all kinds of people! Did you know that many young African American women don't want to date African American men if they don't have a car or don't have one? In fact, many young Black women prefer to only date people who represent the subversive side of society; known as ""Thugs"" or ""Street Hustlers""; Did you also know that many young African Americans prefer to buy expensive luxury cars while living in government housing, better known as ""the projects,"" rather than moving out, buying new homes, saving or even investing? “Attention” This is not another “Boys in the Hood” story! The newly distinguished members of ""Black Generation It is a gripping expose that sheds light on the oppressive and often discriminatory nature of ""mainstream American society."" A society that has nurtured a rampant disregard for self-respect and enlightenment that many young African-Americans and women now suffer from. The writer supports his arguments with direct references to the overwhelming number of young black single mothers trying to raise children, many of whom are teenagers; and stupid criteria used to choose partners; is often based on nothing more than the young black man's tough or cool reputation in the neighborhood.   The author also identifies self-destructive and often criminal behaviors that many young black men engage in on a daily basis, such as refusing to pursue higher education, carrying weapons, robbing, stealing, selling drugs, driving luxury cars, and wearing expensive jewelry. The negative and degrading behavior that both men and women engage in is largely due to the lack of guidance that comes from growing up in fatherless homes. These poor choices and behavioral disorders, combined with the unnecessary burden it places on taxpaying citizens in the form of welfare abuses and prison overcrowding, are the primary causes of the cycle of rampant poverty and lack of direction that currently exists in young ""black America"" ​​today.

Milosevic The goal of freedom is the destruction of the Socialist Party of Serbia.         Although, due to the same views, at one time the most polar socialist after the president of this party, prof. Branislav Ivkovic was expelled from the SPS ranks, and today the SPS leadership uses increasingly strict qualifications at the expense of its president, without fear that any of them may be expelled from the party.         In recent days, it is not uncommon for the party leadership to hear that Slobodan Milosevic is not the party and that he does not represent the party, but that the party is the leadership and management board of this party.         However, not everything is going according to the management's plans among the party's members and supporters.         Estimates even say that Bata Zivojinovic will win only 1% of the votes in the September elections.  Most party members still believe in their hero, Slobodan Milosevic.         According to party members, currently those in the party leadership who in recent years disinformed the party's president are trying to save themselves by eliminating president Slobodan Milosevic when they realized that they had made the call.         Young socialists, of which there are not many, as SPS once boasted, seem to be on the side of the party's chairman. Thus, during performances before municipal boards, you can hear convincing speeches by Dejan Stjepanovic and Igor Raicevic, as well as some of Milinka Isaković from the ranks of young socialists, members of the organizational and political committee of the SPS president.          The speeches of these young people among party members are even ten times more important than the speeches of professional politicians who carry the burden of the past behind them.          The position of the Young Socialists' leadership differs from the position of the youth council, which also sides with the president.           Branko Ruzic and Dejan Backovic, once the greatest defenders and representatives of Slobodan Milosevic's character and actions, have today become his greatest critics. They are trying in every possible way to marginalize the group of young people who support him.          Even in recent days, it has been heard that the best recipe for maintaining leadership among young people is to connect family ties, which is why the chairwoman of the Young Socialists of Belgrade, Ana Djurovic, married Branko Ruzić, the chairman of the Young Socialists of Serbia, who took Dejn Backov, her vice-president, as her godfather. . Currently, Backovic is getting married to a young socialist who is a member of the youth council, and at the same time the sister of one of the IO GO SPS members is taking on another young socialist from the youth council as her godfather. To summarize, the young people in SPS behave like Italian mafia families in the 1960s in the USA.           The question is what will happen at the end of this story, but members and supporters will judge the performance of their leaders in the presidential election.           We just wonder what they will do if Bata is worse than Seselj, who was supported by President Slobodan Milosevic as a presidential candidate?        ________________________________________________________ Powered by List Builder To unsubscribe, click the link: http://lb.bcentral.com/ex/sp?c=15279&s=90B245569C3B981A&m=4",1

I have become aware that there is no formal distinction separating young African?Americans from the general definition of ""Generation X"". Aside from it being regarded as the generation that followed ""Baby Boomers""  it's important to point out there is no root definition for this term as well. Since the theme of this work is centered on identifying the realities and misconceptions of young African?American culture  I have chosen a definition that incorporates all of the components that were part of my birth  childhood  and young adult life. Taken from a web site entitled ""Generation X""  created and maintained by the Colorado College  the definition is as follows:     ""We are a group of people born between 1961 and 1981. We are individuals who live for the 'here and now'  like to experiment  and who require immediate results. We are typically selfish  and cynical  and depend a lot on our parents. We question authority  and feel like we carry the burden of the previous generations. It's that simple. It seems we have come to be called ""Xer's"" simply because we represent something negative to our elders. We may be the one thing all of the generations that precede us have in common  that is the ability to speak assuredly about our shortcomings. Of course  they overlook the fact that we are their responsibility  or actually their fault. Our generation will be called upon to look after our parents knowing they failed to look after us. Intergenerational justice failed somewhere along the way and it will be our task to either rectify it or make it worse."" ""We are a group of individuals who grew up with no one at home after school. It appears we have little hope for the future. No jobs  no homes  and basically no money are almost expected of us. These bleak prospects  along with the fact that we will be forced to support the largest amount of senior citizens ever  do not provide much hope. Some believe that these blockades will be too much for us to handle and we will for the most part fail at life  but many see our individualism and resourcefulness that has been built up through our childhood  as our saviors. We will soon discover who is right and who is wrong.""   This definition is important because it demonstrates the widely held belief that Generation X is comprised of one core group of American citizens. It over generalizes the similarities it expresses  and applies them to all those who were born within the corresponding years. When in fact these ""similarities"" speak primarily to only ""white"" issues and concerns. For instance  ""they"" say ""we"" depend a lot on our parents  but in ghetto America ""we"" could only depend on one our mothers! ""They"" also say  "" . . .we feel like we carry the burden of previous generations "" and "" . . . we will be forced to support the largest amount of senior citizens ever."" In ghetto America  no one ever gives these issues any thought because survival is in the here and now  and is all ""we"" have time for.  I have known for many years that the differences that separate Generation Xer's black and white occupants would eventually be identified. I never knew I would be the one doing it. Extracting the ""Black"" from ""Generation X"" and categorizing it for its own sake is a necessary and important contingency. Without doing so  the social ills that plague Ghetto America would be lost within the generalities that are explained away as part of a collective American identity. There are many hidden truths that exist in black America today. ""White America"" charges that we spend our time collecting welfare  refusing to vote  reading elementary styled books  watching music videos  day dreaming of becoming rappers  basketball players  selling drugs  and making babies. Much of this is supported in Marlon Riggs's documentary entitled ""Ethnic Notions."" When African Americans are mentioned  whites typically envision an image that is strikingly similar to the one that graces the cover of this book. A reality that I confirmed while watching ""Roger & Me "" another documentary written  and directed by Michael Moore. Sadly  many of us have begun to validate this skewed image  while others bend over backwards in an attempt to pretend we do nothing of the kind  only to be contradicted and embarrassed when presented with the daily programming line up for B.E.T. (Black Entertainment Television). Many of us fail to realize  that whatever embarrassment or shame the ex  posed truth may reveal  should be taken as an opportunity to improve  empower  enlighten  and ultimately change anyone who is guilty of perpetrating this kind of behavior. Regarding Black Women: I have known many in my life and although each has had unique attitudes and personalities  I began to notice the majority of them shared the same collective mentality toward black men as a whole-that black men owed them something  and are required to provide and fulfill what was missing from their lives  be it emotional  physical  or economical.  Normally that type of assertion would not warrant opposition from me  so long as a reciprocal attitude was extended. In most cases  it has not been. It's funny though  looking back  I am surprised I never paid any attention to the beliefs and attitudes that different black women subscribe to  or the various schools of thought they possessed. Many have placed strict demands and presumptions on the African?American male  some fair and some unfair. Much of what the public believes and understands about the black female's social structure is often filtered by others in the black community who believe these inaccurate and frequently positive representations will somehow change the reality that is.  What originally sparked my attention was an observation I stumbled upon while skimming through and reading books related to black male and female interaction. I noticed virtually all of the books I read in the genre depict an inaccurate and misleading concentration on the affluent African?American perspective. These stories and commentaries tend to suggest that all African?Americans thrive on a middle?to?upper class professional level. They relay stories of relationship problems with ""Huxtable?like"" bachelors and bachelorettes whose only concern is why the other has not confessed his or her love. As I read these stories I couldn't help but become irritated by the blatant omission of the prevailing majority of blue collar or ""working class"" African?Americans. Although there are those in the black community that can identify with the ""Huxtable?like"" dynamic  unfortunately  they are few and far between.  The majority of stories I have read seem to be geared toward fantasizing and romanticizing the oppressive state of affairs that have plagued Black America. The black authors who have written these books fear the potential backlash awaiting anyone who would dare air out our ""dirty laundry"". The fact is  truth should never be stifled by fear of any kind.  I recently had a candid conversation with some very dear female friends who stated that although they fully acknowledge the terrible state of affairs many of our women are currently drowning in  they felt that publicizing their predicament would be viewed as a form of betrayal. As our discussion intensified  I reminded them that the only way change can be effected is by increasing public awareness that change is needed  and oftentimes  not exposing the truth can be more crippling than the truth itself.  The purpose of my book is in essence an attempt to change the self?destructive thinking and self?imprisoning behavior that ""black male and female generation X"" have been subscribing to. While discussing this with my friend  she suggested I simplify my writing style so my potential black readers could better understand what I'm attempting to convey. Acknowledging the real possibility of my message being misunderstood  I suggest to those readers that if they want to fully appreciate the finer points of this narrative-to grab a dictionary. (Don't feel bad-there were several times I had to as well!) Regarding Black Men: An overwhelming number of us have become preoccupied with being cool  buying sports wear  driving expensive cars  wearing gold or platinum jewelry  and often without legitimate personal wealth and while living under the most deplorable conditions! I have chosen to address this rarely acknowledged side of African?American culture because I have lived it. I have seen the chaos and futility that exists on this level. It is a world of ignorance  selfishness  pre?occupation  and idiocy. In my world there are people who applaud a lack of education  who brag about having served time in U.S. penitentiaries  the types of guns they carry  dope peddling  and chasing women. They champion the notion of having children without any regard to the poor environment many of them currently inhabit. In this world  wearing expensive clothes and carrying fancy handbags is mandatory even if it means spending their last dollar in order to look like they've got a million. It's a world where children dress in over?priced sports wear  mimicking and idolizing whatever popular athlete or rapper is currently in the public eye.  Thinking  such as the belief that fancy clothes are what define one's self?worth  and the possible corruption this thinking breeds  seems to not be an important concern for black mothers. It may come as a shock to know that most African?Americans feel that those who don't have the same  if not better  material possessions  are lesser beings  referring to them as being corny  lame  or broke. Even our ""male rapper"" entertainers promote backward priorities-nothing else matters as long as you look good. ""The Big Tymers""  a popular rap duo  have a song called ""I'm Still Fly""  shown in heavy rotation on B.E.T. and played regularly on black radio stations throughout the country. (""Fly"" is ghetto vernacular for well dressed  also used to describe a female's beauty). Its signature verse asserts:  ""I got gator boots with a pimped out Gucci Suit  can't pay my rent cause all my money's spent  but that's O.K. cause I'm still fly.""  Worse yet  in the song ""Grinding""  the popular duo ""Eclipse"" glorifies the selling of illegal drugs in inner city neighborhoods as children play and dance throughout the entire video. (The term ""grinding"" is ghetto vernacular for the selling of illegal drugs) The fact that this song and video is also shown in heavy rotation on B.E.T. is further evidence that our world is in utter turmoil. Some of the key lyrics to this song are ""grindingyou know what I keep in the lining"" (the area in their coats where they hide illegal drugs) and  ""Patty cake Patty cake I'm the bakers man I bake them cakes as fast as I can and you can tell cause of how my bread stack up and I disguise it as rap so the feds backup""  In this verse  the group refers to the process of cooking cocaine and its transformation into cocaine base or crack. When created it is compressed into the form of a large cookie with the average diameter being the size of a typical cake. (hence the term ""cake"" or sometimes ""pie"") Unfortunately for the rap genre  this song seems to strengthen the long standing argument posed by most whites that rap music is nothing more than an entertainment medium catering to violent drug offenders  who want and do nothing more than carry guns and break the law.  The negative references I've identified have become an integral part of the urban African?American existence. This mutated reality is ridiculous and unacceptable. This ideology should not be permitted to continue any longer than it already has. There is an overwhelming part of the African?American community that is aware of this crippling mentality. There are also many that are unaware and unfortunately  more that do not even care. Those of us who are in the know have a responsibility to educate and enlighten those of us who are not aware of the negative behavior being perpetrated daily. Whether because of habit or misguided values  this type of ideology is cyclical and thrives off of ignorance. It should be apparent to us all that we cannot wait for some other race to come and save us. We must save ourselves! I am well aware that many of you are probably furious by now  and are thinking  what right do I have to express the opinions I have thus far  as well as those I have al  luded too.  I have chosen to chronicle my experiences because of the diversity and seriousness of their content. There is far too much negativity thriving within our culture. There must be acknowledgment and accountability for the truth  whether good or bad. I am aware that not all of ""us"" have succumbed to the crippling mentality that is rampant in our community  and I have chosen to concentrate on individuals who have had a profound impact on my life. Any similarities and generalizations I illustrate are directed solely toward individuals in the black community who share the collective negative thinking and behavior that will hereafter be identified.  Additionally  throughout this book I will refer to African?Americans in four different ways; the first being ""African?Americans""  denoting our status as citizens in the United States; secondly  as ""Black""  a reference that identifies and defines our differences and struggles in this country; third  as ""Niggas "" a term which is often misunderstood and should not be confused with ""Nigger"". The term ""nigga"" has become an accepted form of reference among young black males used to express friendship (hence the term ""My Nigga"") as well as a blanket reference when speaking to  of  or about other black males in a non?personal manner. I felt it necessary to make this distinction because many of the experiences I will refer to mandate the use of the term to effectively communicate the attitude and mood that existed during the time each story took place; and fourth  as ""Ghetto""  this term is largely intended as an internal reference commonly understood by blacks as a means to define the   less polished members of our community.  It is important to note that the use of either term has no negative connotation and is therefore not to be associated with any feeling as such.  My commentary is based on real?life situations  both good and bad  and how one African?American man was affected by them. To that end  I feel it is necessary to acknowledge that my intention is not to condemn the individuals I have encountered. Despite the negativity they have displayed  I only want to make them aware that the selfish and self debasing attitudes they subscribed to  in many ways  has caused them to become their own worst enemy. In the case of the black female's negative and limited perspective toward black men  the world  and subconsciously themselves  I submit that this mentality is perhaps single?handedly responsible for the lack of success  happiness  and quality of life that is at the center of every African?American woman's fantasy quest. It is also important to note that the selfish and negative attitudes at the core of the tension that exists between black women and men  has been deliberately created by ""White America"". For example  much of the existing resentment between black women and men can be traced as far back as slavery on up to present day. Many past issues have taken on new identities and have re?emerged in the form of corporate acceptance of black women and the corporate exclusion of black men. The resulting economic independence that some black women now enjoy has caused them to challenge and judge the black man for his absence within corporate America  without realizing and ackno  wledging that this absence is by design.  There are other ""core"" issues that have been passed down and nurtured from generation to generation  such as color barriers  light skin versus dark skin  good hair versus bad hair  loyalty  devotion  and economic status. Believe it or not  there was once a time when black women refused to date a black man if he didn't sell drugs or was not ""thugged out"". (a term for being rough or hoodlum-like) The reasoning behind it being that the ""thug "" and ""drug dealer"" lifestyle was synonymous with financial independence.  These issues  among others  relate directly to the confused mentality that exists within our internal society. Sadly that ""confused mentality"" is responsible for much of the neglect the African American ""ghetto"" community receives at the hands of our more affluent brethren. Who have locked it away in the basement  and seems to be more concerned with convincing the rest of the world that ""ghetto America does not exist. Furthermore  the lack of acknowledgement of which I speak should not be confused with the impoverished masses of the African American community.  Their plight is a well-known reality  but in many cases much of ghetto America falls under that same umbrella. Be advised: this book is not a colorful or lighthearted look into ""Black America"".  Rather it should be viewed as a legitimate tool for identifying and changing the backward thinking that so many young African Americans (including myself) have come to perpetuate. Moreover  that ""backward thinking"" is the main   cause of our inability to strive for a common goal. An outcome that must be met; and can only be met  with Godly faith  positive strategy  cooperation  love  loyalty  self and mutual respect. *************************************************************  To read More go to www.blackrealitypublishing.com   To Unsubscribe: send mail to majordomo@FreeBSD.org with ""unsubscribe freebsd-ports"" in the body of the message",1

Content type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii X-Virus Scanned: by amavisd-milter (http://amavis.org/) Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit g8B8POE9005100 Status: RO X-Status: X-Keywords: X-UID: 13 The Socialist Party of Serbia led by a group of old socialists led by Milomir Minić finally renounced the politics and heroic attitude of the party's chairman, Slobodan Milosevic, announcing that a poorly informed man, especially not from a cell, cannot lead such a large party as the Socialist Party Serbia, so his name was also Slobodan Milosevic.        Socialists, who today say that they are no longer idolaters of Slobodan Milosevic, while remaining in constant contact with members and sympathizers of this party, are trying to separate the defense of Slobodan Milosevic in The Hague from political life in Serbia, attributing to Milosevic's defenders from the National Committee for the release of S. Milosevic the goal freedom is to destroy the Socialist Party of Serbia.         Although, due to the same views, at one time the most polar socialist after the president of this party, prof. Branislav Ivkovic was expelled from the SPS ranks, and today the SPS leadership uses increasingly strict qualifications at the expense of its president, without fear that any of them may be expelled from the party.         In recent days, it is not uncommon for the party leadership to hear that Slobodan Milosevic is not the party and that he does not represent the party, but that the party is the leadership and management board of this party.         However, not everything is going according to the management's plans among the party's members and supporters.         Estimates even say that Bata Zivojinovic will win only 1% of the votes in the September elections.  Most party members still believe in their hero, Slobodan Milosevic.         According to party members, currently those in the party leadership who in recent years disinformed the party's president are trying to save themselves by eliminating president Slobodan Milosevic when they realized that they had made the call.         Young socialists, of which there are not many, as SPS once boasted, seem to be on the side of the party's chairman. Thus, during performances before municipal boards, you can hear convincing speeches by Dejan Stjepanovic and Igor Raicevic, as well as some of Milinka Isaković from the ranks of young socialists, members of the organizational and political committee of the SPS president.          The speeches of these young people among party members are even ten times more important than the speeches of professional politicians who carry the burden of the past behind them.          The position of the Young Socialists' leadership differs from the position of the youth council, which also sides with the president.           Branko Ruzic and Dejan Backovic, once the greatest defenders and representatives of Slobodan Milosevic's character and actions, have today become his greatest critics. They are trying in every possible way to marginalize the group of young people who support him.          Even in recent days, it has been heard that the best recipe for maintaining leadership among young people is to connect family ties, which is why the chairwoman of the Young Socialists of Belgrade, Ana Djurovic, married Branko Ruzić, the chairman of the Young Socialists of Serbia, who took Dejn Backov, her vice-president, as her godfather. . Currently, Backovic is getting married to a young socialist who is a member of the youth council, and at the same time the sister of one of the IO GO SPS members is taking on another young socialist from the youth council as her godfather. To summarize, the young people in SPS behave like Italian mafia families in the 1960s in the USA.           The question is what will happen at the end of this story, but members and supporters will judge the performance of their leaders in the presidential election.           We just wonder what they will do if Bata is worse than Seselj, who was supported by President Slobodan Milosevic as a presidential candidate?        ________________________________________________________ Powered by List Builder To unsubscribe, click the link: http://lb.bcentral.com/ex/sp?c=15279&s=54EE057E0B6864FB&m=5",1

I am looking for investment properties in the Midwest. The problem I have is that not everyone has experience with the properties I am looking for. You know which houses are almost certain to not sell; maybe they're really ugly, or they need a lot of work, or they live in a bad neighborhood. But for some reason, houses just aren't selling.  I need these homes... Most agents I've dealt with have been hesitant because the time and effort invested doesn't give much of a return. However, the private investors I work with use ""unconventional"" private financing, which allows us both to avoid long-term loan approvals. Most of the time we just pay cash and close within a week. I am pre-qualified by Greentree Funding for a $900,000 purchase mortgage loan based on a non-owner occupied loan at 90% LTV.  (And of course you will receive your full commission.) I am not a licensed real estate agent nor am I affiliated with any real estate company, which means I am free to work with you in any way I want. Don't get the impression that you have to pay below market value to be interested. Sometimes I even manage to pay the retail price. The only guarantee I give is that I will not waste your time and in most cases I can tell you over the phone whether I am interested or not.   If you are interested in purchasing a design home from our inventory or would like information about forming an alliance with Synteligent Properties, please contact me at @ 847.366.4300 or email me at @ jeremy@synteligent.com Best wishes Jeremy Lessaris 847.366.4300 www .intelligent. com jeremy@synteligent.com To unsubscribe: send an email to majordomo@FreeBSD.org with ""unsubscribe freebsd-ports"" in the body of the message",1

MICHAEL BUNDU” Subject: [ILUG] HELP From: ilug-admin@linux.ie Errors To: ilug-admin@linux.ie X -Mailman-Version: 1.1 Precedence: Bulk List ID: Irish Linux User Group X-Beenthere: ilug @linux.ie Content transfer encoding: 8bit FROM: COL. MICHAEL BUNDU.  DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO.  Tel. No.: Your country Intl. access code +8821652098236 e-mail: mikebundu@rediffmail.com Dear Sir/Madam, I AM ASKING FOR IMMEDIATE HELP.   Please allow me to get to know you in this informal way. This is necessary due to my urgent need to find a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner. This request may seem strange and unwanted, but I seek your understanding and pray that you will take it seriously. My name is KOL. MICHAEL BUNDU of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and one of the close associates of former President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo LAURENT KABILA, of blessed memory, may his soul rest in peace.   Due to LAURENT KABILA'S military campaign to expel the rebels in my country, I and some of my colleagues were ordered by the late President Kabila to go abroad to purchase weapons and ammunition worth only twenty million five hundred thousand US dollars (US$20 ). 500,000.00) to fight the rebel group. We then received this money privately from then-President LAURENT KABILA, without the knowledge of other cabinet members. But when President Kabila was killed in a bloody shootout by one of his bodyguards the day before he was scheduled to leave Congo, we immediately decided to transfer the funds to a private security company here in Congo for safekeeping. The security of this amount is currently at risk due to the arrest and seizure of the property of Col. Rasheidi Karesava (one of Laurent Kabila's aides), a tribesman and other military personnel from our tribe by the new President of the Democratic Party of the Republic of Congo, son of the late President Laurent Kabila Joseph Kabila.   Therefore, we need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who will help us transfer this money from my country as the beneficiary.  We have enough ""CONTACTS"" here to transfer the fund under diplomatic cover to a security company in Europe on your behalf. This is to ensure that diplomatic baggage will be marked ""CONFIDENTIAL"" and will not pass normal customs/airport inspection.   Our inability to get this money out of the Congo all this time is due to a lack of trust in our supposed good friends (Western countries) who suddenly became hostile to those of us who worked with the late President Kabila immediately after his son took office . Although we have not seen or met each other, the information we have gathered from the associate working in your country has encouraged us and convinced us that with your sincere help, this transaction will be handled properly, with modesty and honesty, and will be a huge success within two weeks . This money is a state fund and therefore requires complete confidentiality.   We ask you to act on our behalf as a beneficiary of this fund in Europe. This is because we have limited ability to move and observe, so we want to be especially careful not to lose the fund we have worked so hard to earn. So if you want to help us move this fund out of Congo, you can contact me via my email addresses. Telephone/fax numbers. above, providing your telephone fax number and personal details so that we can discuss the terms and the amount of your share (in percentage) in helping us.  Please note that there is NO RISK associated with this Agreement as everyone's safety is guaranteed if we follow the required guidelines. I will therefore provide you with further details of this Agreement as soon as I am satisfied that you are interested in assisting us.   I must take this opportunity and means to beg you for your utmost leniency and to keep this matter extremely secret, regardless of your decision, while awaiting your prompt response. Thank you and God bless you.  Best regards, KOL. MICHAEL BUNDU (RTD). m_bundu@rediffmail.com N\B.

"Date: Wednesday 18 September 2002 01:11:52 Date: Wednesday 18 September 2002 01:11:52 OFFICE:EGNR. FEMI DANIEL FEDERAL MINISTRY OF WORKS AND HOUSING FEDERAL SECRETARIAT COMPLEX IKOYI-LAGOS.  ATTN: First, I must ask for your strictest confidence in this transaction, this is due to its completely confidential and top secret nature as you were introduced to me in confidence through the Nigerian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.  We are top officials of the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing (FMW&H), Federal Ministry of Finance and the President, constituting the Contract Review Panel (CRP) established by the Federal Government of Nigeria to review contracts awarded by the previous military administration.   While working on CRP, we discovered this fund that resulted from grossly overbilled contracts that were completed for FMW&H during the last administration. The companies that executed the contracts have been duly paid and the commissioned contracts leave a sum of $21.4 million in the Central Bank of Nigeria trust account, ready for payment.  Therefore, my colleagues on the panel commissioned me as a matter of trust to find a foreign partner to whom we could transfer the US21.4 amount, legally subcontracting this task to your company. Bearing this in mind, our civil service Code of Conduct prohibits us from owning foreign companies or maintaining foreign accounts while on government service, hence the need for a foreign partner.  We have agreed that the funds will be made available once they have been deposited into your account. (1) 30% of the money will go to you for serving as a beneficiary of the fund.

ATTN: First, I must ask for your strictest confidence in this transaction, this is due to its completely confidential and top secret nature as you were introduced to me in confidence through the Nigerian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.  We are top officials of the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing (FMW&H), Federal Ministry of Finance and the President, constituting the Contract Review Panel (CRP) established by the Federal Government of Nigeria to review contracts awarded by the previous military administration.   While working on CRP, we discovered this fund that resulted from grossly overbilled contracts that were completed for FMW&H during the last administration. The companies that executed the contracts have been duly paid and the commissioned contracts leave a sum of $21.4 million in the Central Bank of Nigeria trust account, ready for payment.  Therefore, my colleagues on the panel commissioned me as a matter of trust to find a foreign partner to whom we could transfer the US21.4 amount, legally subcontracting this task to your company. Bearing this in mind, our civil service Code of Conduct prohibits us from owning foreign companies or maintaining foreign accounts while on government service, hence the need for a foreign partner.  We have agreed that the funds will be made available once they have been deposited into your account. (1) 30% of the money will go to you for serving as a beneficiary of the fund. (2) 10% has been set aside as an abstract projection to reimburse both parties for incidental expenses that may arise during the transaction. (3) 60% for us, government officials (with whom we intend to start import business together with you). All logistics are in place and all arrangements have been made to enable the transaction to be completed smoothly within ten to fourteen days from commencement upon receipt of the following information; Your name and surname Company name Address Details and scope of activity Telephone and fax numbers.

"Date: Thu  19 Sep 2002 02:14:46 +1000 X-Mailer: eGroups Message Poster  Hello  You may have seen this business before and ignored it. I know I did - many times! However  please take a few moments to read this letter. I was amazed when the profit potential of this business finally sunk in... and it works!  With easy-to-use e-mail tools and opt-in e-mail  success in this business is now fast  easy and well within the capabilities of ordinary people who know little about internet marketing. And the earnings potential is truly staggering!  I'll make you a promise. READ THIS E-MAIL TO THE END! - follow what it says to the letter - and you will not worry whether a RECESSION is coming or not  who is President  or whether you keep your current job or not. Yes  I know what you are thinking. I never responded to one of these before either. One day though  something just said: ""You throw away $25.00 going to a movie for 2 hours with your wife. What the heck."" Believe me  no matter where you believe those ""feelings"" come from  I thank every day that I had that feeling.   I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be doing had I not. Read on. It's true. Every word of it. It is legal. I checked. Simply because you are buying and selling something of value.  AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV:  Making over half a million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your home.  THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET! ================================================== BE AN INTERNET MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!!  Before you say ""Bull""  please read the following. This is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the internet  a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below  to see if it really can make people money. The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal.  Their findings proved once and for all that there are ""absolutely NO laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can 'follow the simple instructions' they are bound to make some mega bucks with only $25 out of pocket cost"".  DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED  IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER.  This is what one had to say: ""Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I was approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment  I received a total $610 470.00 in 21 weeks  with money still coming in.""  Pam Hedland  Fort Lee  New Jersey. ================================================== Another said: ""This program has been around for a long time but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again in the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to come in. First month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made a total of $290 000.00. So far  in the past 8 months by re-entering the program  I have made over $710 000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change anything.""  More testimonials later but first  =======  ==== PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE ==== $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$  If you would like to make at least $500 000 every 4 to 5 months easily and comfortably  please read the following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN!!!  $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$  FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND  YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE  GUARANTEED!  INSTRUCTIONS:  =====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below =====  For each report  send $5 CASH  THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON  YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.  ===WHEN YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER  MAKE SURE === ===YOU ORDER EACH OF THE 5 REPORTS! === You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5 = $25.00.  Within a few days you will receive  via e-mail  each of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1 000's of people who will order them from you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case something happens to your computer.  IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report  or their sequence on the list  in any way other than what is instructed below in steps 1 through 6 or you will lose out on the majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this works  you will also see how it will not work if you change it.   Remember  this method has been tested  and if you alter it  it will NOT work!!! People have tried to put their friends'/relatives' names on all five thinking they could get all the money. But it does not work this way. Believe us  some have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not try to change anything other than what is instructed. Because if you do  it will not work for you. Remember  honesty reaps the reward!!!   This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You are offering a product for sale and getting paid for it. Treat it as such and you will be VERY profitable in a short period of time.  1.. After you have ordered all 5 reports  take this advertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # 5. This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.  2.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.  3.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.  4.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.  5.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2  6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.  PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY! This is critical to YOUR success.  ================================================== **** Take this entire letter  with the modified list of names  and save it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.  Save this on a disk as well just in case you lose any data. To assist you with marketing your business on the internet  the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally  where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more. There are 2 primary methods to get this venture going:  METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY ==================================================  Let's say that you decide to start small  just to see how it goes  and we will assume you and those involved send out only 5 000 e-mails each. Let's also assume that the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much better but let's just say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only 5 000 each.  Continuing with this example  you send out only 5 000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response  that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded by sending out 5 000 e-mails each for a total of 50 000. Out of those 50 000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's 100 people who responded and ordered Report # 2.  Those 100 people mail out 5 000 e-mails each for a total of 500 000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.  Those 1000 people send 5 000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response is 10 000 orders for Report # 4.  Those 10 000 people send out 5 000 e-mails each for a total of 50 000 000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100 000 orders for Report # 5.  THAT'S 100 000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500 000.00 (half a million dollars).  Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3.....$5 000 + 4..... $50 000 + 5.... $500 000 .... Grand Total=$555 550.00  NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT  YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY! ==================================================  REMEMBER FRIEND  THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5 000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100 000 e-mails each or more?  There are over 150 million people on the internet worldwide and counting  with thousands more coming online every day. Believe me  many people will do just that  and more!  METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET ==================================================  Advertising on the net is very  very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive  all you must do is e-mail them the report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day service on all orders.  This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out  with your name and address on it  will be prompt because they cannot advertise until they receive the report.  ===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ==================== The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is illegal or somehow ""wrong"". It is simply about time. Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved  etc. Concealing it is simply so no one can SEE there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you.  ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of paper  write the NUMBER & the NAME of the report you are ordering  YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address.  PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW : ==================================================   REPORT # 1: ""The Insider's Guide To Advertising for Free On The Net""  Order Report #: 1 from Rui Sousa Santos P.O. Box 132 Taylors Lakes VIC  3038 Australia  ______________________________________________________  REPORT # 2: ""The Insider's Guide To Sending Bulk Email On The Net""  Order Report # 2 from:  Richard Moulton P.O. Box 82 Hot Springs MT 59845 USA  ___________________________________________________  REPORT # 3: ""Secret To Multilevel Marketing On The Net""  Order Report # 3 from:  J.siden krondikesvgen 54 A 83147 stersund Sweden  _____________________________________________________  REPORT # 4: ""How To Become A Millionaire Using MLM & The Net""  Order Report # 4 from:  Francis Kidd P.O. Box 209 Homestead PA 15120 USA  __________________________________________________  REPORT # 5: ""How To Send Out One Million Emails For Free""  Order Report # 5 From:  M.J. Lee P.O. Box 19 52 Victoria Drive London SW19 6BD United Kingdom ______________________________________________________ $$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$  Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:  === If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 2 weeks  continue sending e-mails until you do.  === After you have received 10 orders  2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for REPORT # 2. If you do not  continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do.  ** Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report # 2  YOU CAN RELAX  because the system is already working for you  and the cash will continue to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your name is moved down on the list  you are placed in front of a different report.  You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate from this business !!! ================================================= FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM:  You have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life  with NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can make more money in the next few weeks and months than you have ever imagined. Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way. It works exceedingly well as it is now.  Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your name and address in Report #1 and moved others to #2 .....# 5 as instructed above. One of the people you send this to may send out 100 000 or more e-mails and your name will be on every one of them.   Remember though  the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach. So my friend  I have given you the ideas  information  materials and opportunity to become financially independent.  IT IS UP TO YOU NOW !  =============MORE TESTIMONIALS=============== ""My name is Mitchell. My wife  Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving 'junk mail'. I made fun of the whole thing  spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of her  and was ready to lay the old 'I told you so' on her when the thing didn't work.   Well  the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she had received total $ 147 200.00 ......... all cash! I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her 'hobby'.""  Mitchell Wolf M.D.  Chicago  Illinois ================================================ ""Not being the gambling type  it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan. But conservative as I am  I decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back. I was surprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with orders. I made $319 210.00 in the first 12 weeks.   The nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return and so big.""  Dan Sondstrom  Alberta  Canada ================================================= ""I had received this program before. I deleted it  but later I wondered if I should have given it a try. Of course  I had no idea who to contact to get another copy  so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone else......... 11 months passed then it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one! I made more than $490 000 on my first try and all the money came within 22 weeks.""  Susan De Suza  New York  N.Y. ================================================= ""It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with little cost to you. I followed the simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the money started to come in. My first month I made $20  in the 2nd month I made $560.00 and by the end of the third month my total cash count was $362 840.00. Life is beautiful  Thanx to internet.""

"Date: Thu. Sep 19, 2002 01:15:03 +1100 MIME Version: 1.0 Content Type: Text/Plain; charset=""iso-8859-1"" X Priority: 3 (Normal) X-Msmail Priority: Normal  I work about two hours a day.   I'm ambitious but extremely lazy and I earn over $250,000 a year.  Are you curious yet?  I'll tell you my secret in a moment. It's the Internet's dirty little secret... You've probably heard stories about people making huge amounts of money online, but you thought they were CEOs of large corporations, famous programmers, or boy geniuses.  Well, grasshopper, think again... It's people like you and me who make the real money.  Yes, people like YOU AND ME!  Since the dot-com bubble burst in 1999, small business owners have become increasingly wealthy and Fortune 500 companies are looking for bankruptcy lawyers.  Today, small business owners and ordinary people like you and me can use the Internet to achieve complete financial freedom WITH NO INVESTMENT and little work.  How?  Learning the most profitable marketing technique ever created - it's called BULK EMAIL.  If you have ever received an email advertisement, you know what a bulk email is.  I bet you can't click the REMOVE button fast enough on most ads, right? You may not want their product, but remember that thousands of other people probably will.  Bulk email is a percentage game - every bulk emailer who contacts you earns a six-figure income online.  I guarantee it.  Now let's go back to math 101 and crunch some numbers... If you're selling on eBay, you're paying anywhere from a few dollars to over a hundred dollars to list a single listing.  How many people see your ad?  Maybe a few thousand, or even ten or twenty thousand in a few days.  Using bulk email, YOU CAN SEND YOUR ADVERTISEMENT TO OVER MILLIONS OF PEOPLE A DAY, at virtually no cost.  Whether you send 100,000 emails or 100 million emails, the price is the same. ZERO!  Stop paying these outrageous listing fees when almost no one sees your ad!  Imagine you have a decent product with a profit margin of $20.00 on each sale.  If you send an email ad to 500,000 people and only one person in a thousand actually places an order, then you have just generated 500 orders and made $10,000 in a few hours of work.    It's that simple... All you have to do is convince ONE PERSON OUT OF A THOUSAND to buy your stuff and you're filthy rich.  The best part is that anyone can do it.  It doesn't matter whether you're a nineteen-year-old college student using a computer in your dorm or a fifty-year-old executive working in an office building in New York.  Anyone, and I repeat ANYONE, can start sending mass emails with virtually no upfront costs.  All you need is a few days of study, a lot of ambition and basic knowledge of the Internet.  I dropped out of college at 19 to take advantage of the Dot Com mania and never looked back.  I started with no money, no product to sell, and only the most basic computer skills.  I saw an opportunity and I took it.  A few years later I bought my own house - for CASH.    You don't need any money.  You don't need the product. You don't have to be a computer geek and no experience is required.    If you saw a job advertisement like this in the newspaper, you would jump at it immediately.  It would be a dream come true. So what are you waiting for?!  I'll ask you four simple questions.  If you answer YES to all of these questions, I can almost promise you will make at least $100,000 using bulk email this year.  Here's... Do you have basic networking experience?  Do you have a computer and internet connection? Do you have a few hours of free time every day?   Do you want to earn extra money with full financial freedom in mind?    If you answer YES to these questions, you could earn anywhere from $5,000 to $20,000 a week working from home.  Say goodbye to your day job - it sure beats the 9-to-5 grind!  All you need is ambition and commitment.  This is no get-rich-quick scheme.  To make big money, you have to work, but ANYONE - and I mean ANYONE - can do it.  You're probably wondering how hard it is to get started.   Don't worry, that's not the case! I will show you step by step how to start your first email campaign and how to build a thriving online business.  You'll be generating orders and making money in less than seven days.  OK, what if you don't have anything to sell?  No problem!!  I'll show you where to find hot products that are selling like CRAAAAAZY! Most people delay starting an online business because they don't have anything to sell, but I'm removing that obstacle now.   After reading the Bulkbook, you can build a complete product line in less than two hours!  There's no excuse not to start! I'll have you ready to go within seven days. In fact… I personally guarantee that you will be starting your own massive email campaign in less than a week after reading the Bulkbook!  I will provide you with a toll-free telephone number where you can contact me 24 hours a day, seven days a week;  Where else will you find this level of service?!  I'll also include a step-by-step guide to starting your first email campaign titled ""Seven Days to Bulk Email Success.""  This separate guide provides a daily routine you can follow, along with detailed instructions on how to get started.  For example, on your first day I will teach you where to find a product to sell.  The next day you will learn how to build a new mailing list.  On the seventh day, just click ""send""!  Your first campaign is ready to launch.  As a special bonus, you will receive a FREE copy of our STEALTH MASS MAILER, a very powerful mass email program that costs $49.99! If you place your order NOW, I will include up to 7 million email addresses absolutely FREE!  Stop wasting money on listing fee ads and banner ads - they don't work and never will!

"Date: Thu. Sep 19, 2002 22:57:17 +0100 MIME version: 1.0 Content type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII =This is definitely the answer we've all been waiting for================ Every now and then something like this comes up you just know from the people involved based on the details or just from a gut feeling that ​​it will be something unique, with huge potential and hope. Once you know it, it's embedded deep in your bones and it's hard not to get excited and shout it out to the world, which is why I'm writing to you today. While this program has great potential to be as big as anything else on the Internet and you will soon see it advertised and promoted everywhere you go, I would like to give you the opportunity to arrive early before the masses. Traditionally, any MLM (Multi-Level Marketing for Newbies) has a few drawbacks that make it difficult for the programs to survive after the initial buzz. Today we launched the solution to these problems, the newest and most innovative system ever to appear in multi-level marketing. With the new software system and brilliant payout plan combined with 100% payout, everyone is a winner.    The truth is that you have to see it to believe it, instead of feeding you a lot of hype and telling you that this is the miracle you have been looking for, a magical connection that will end all your problems and many other things, you don't have to listen, I will just give you a very a simple offer. Send me an email with the subject line ""Send Link"" to itshappening@mail2world.com and I'll send you the link so you can test drive it completely risk-free. You can get a bird's eye view inside and discover the inner workings of this revolutionary new discovery in online earning opportunities. If you decide you like what you see, you will have the option to activate your position, but this is completely up to you. This isn't a trick. I'm just so confident that this is such a solid program and a unique but solid opportunity that I don't want you to miss out on the chance to get an early spot. With an explosive start, positions will fill up quickly and you'll have the chance to explore the pre-dive program first. If you're one of those cautious people (and there aren't any on the Internet these days) who like to ""look before you leap,"" this is your chance. Thank you for your time and I hope you discover why we all smile!   Please do not treat this message as spam. I am a professional and successful networker with a database of 100,000. I was persuaded to purchase this list of 200,000 people's names, which I am sure only includes those who have agreed to receive information. I haven't used this marketing tool before and honestly, I doubt its validity. However, after spending time purchasing it, I initially only send this email to a small number of email addresses (2,000) to evaluate the results. If you would like more information, I will be happy to provide the link without any obligation.

WILLIAMS FALANA (SAN) Sir, I am an attorney at Williams Falana and a member of the Nigeria Bar Association (NBA). Your contact came to me via the World Business Encyclopedia. Therefore, I have decided to introduce this company to you in confidence for the mutual benefit of both of us.   An amount of 48 million dollars (forty-eight million United States) was deposited with a security company here in the country by the late Head of State (GEN.SANI ABACHA) for safekeeping. This money was deposited in secure vaults/boxes and marked as personal effects, so the security company does not know the true contents of the boxes. The money was originally intended to be used for his political campaign.  Since I was his family representative, he confided in me the relevant documents regarding this deposit before he died of cardiac arrest.  In fact, we have made arrangements with the foreign security company to transfer this money via diplomatic shipment to its offshore branch, where you will be required to claim the shipment as the true beneficiary of the shipment. You should know that this business is safe and 100% risk-free as it does not involve drug money or terrorist funds.   If you are interested in doing this transaction with me, 20% will be for you for your help, 5% for general expenses and 75% for us.  You are required to promptly email your full name and address, which I will use to create an agreement that will guide and protect both of us in this transaction, and which will also be used to change ownership of the shipment to your name as the beneficiary of the shipment.  Please also send me phone and fax numbers to facilitate communication. When you express your desire to me by sending the above requirement. The transaction will be completed within 7 (seven) business days.  I will be waiting for your urgent reply.

Due to the popularity of this letter on the internet  a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below  to see if it really can make people money.

DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED  IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER.  This is what one had to say: ""Thanks to this profitable opportunity.

INSTRUCTIONS:  =====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below =====  For each report  send $5 CASH  THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON  YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.  ===WHEN YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER  MAKE SURE === ===YOU ORDER EACH OF THE 5 REPORTS! === You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5 = $25.00.  Within a few days you will receive  via e-mail  each of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1 000's of people who will order them from you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case something happens to your computer.  IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report  or their sequence on the list  in any way other than what is instructed below in steps 1 through 6 or you will lose out on the majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this works  you will also see how it will not work if you change it.   Remember  this method has been tested  and if you alter it  it will NOT work!!! People have tried to put their friends'/relatives' names on all five thinking they could get all the money. But it does not work this way. Believe us  some have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not try to change anything other than what is instructed. Because if you do  it will not work for you. Remember  honesty reaps the reward!!!   This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You are offering a product for sale and getting paid for it. Treat it as such and you will be VERY profitable in a short period of time.  1.. After you have ordered all 5 reports  take this advertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # 5. This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.  2.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.  3.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.  4.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.  5.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2  6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.  PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY! This is critical to YOUR success.  ================================================== **** Take this entire letter  with the modified list of names  and save it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.  Save this on a disk as well just in case you lose any data. To assist you with marketing your business on the internet  the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally  where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more. There are 2 primary methods to get this venture going:  METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY ==================================================  Let's say that you decide to start small  just to see how it goes  and we will assume you and those involved send out only 5 000 e-mails each. Let's also assume that the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much better but let's just say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only 5 000 each.  Continuing with this example  you send out only 5 000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response  that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded by sending out 5 000 e-mails each for a total of 50 000. Out of those 50 000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's 100 people who responded and ordered Report # 2.  Those 100 people mail out 5 000 e-mails each for a total of 500 000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.  Those 1000 people send 5 000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response is 10 000 orders for Report # 4.  Those 10 000 people send out 5 000 e-mails each for a total of 50 000 000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100 000 orders for Report # 5.  THAT'S 100 000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500 000.00 (half a million dollars).  Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3.....$5 000 + 4..... $50 000 + 5.... $500 000 .... Grand Total=$555 550.00  NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT  YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY! ==================================================  REMEMBER FRIEND  THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5 000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100 000 e-mails each or more?  There are over 150 million people on the internet worldwide and counting  with thousands more coming online every day. Believe me  many people will do just that  and more!  METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET ==================================================  Advertising on the net is very  very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive  all you must do is e-mail them the report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day service on all orders.  This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out  with your name and address on it  will be prompt because they cannot advertise until they receive the report.  ===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ==================== The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is illegal or somehow ""wrong"". It is simply about time. Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved  etc. Concealing it is simply so no one can SEE there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you.  ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of paper  write the NUMBER & the NAME of the report you are ordering  YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address.  PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW : ================================================== REPORT # 1: ""The Insider's Guide To Advertising for Free On The Net"" Order Report #1 from:  Robert Borowczyk ul. J. Olbrachta 118C m. 28 01-373 Warsaw Poland  ______________________________________________________  REPORT # 2: ""The Insider's Guide To Sending Bulk Email On The Net"" Order Report # 2 from:   Mohammad Faraziyan Engelbertstr. 25  40233 Dsseldorf Germany   ______________________________________________________  REPORT # 3: ""Secret To Multilevel Marketing On The Net"" Order Report # 3 from:  Luis Pastor Apartado 81 48080 Bilbao Spain   ______________________________________________________  REPORT # 4: ""How To Become A Millionaire Using MLM & The Net"" Order Report # 4 from:    Ali Reza Auf den Holln 68 44894 Bochum Germany   ______________________________________________________  REPORT # 5: ""How To Send Out One Million Emails For Free"" Order Report # 5 From:  J.siden krondikesvgen 54 A 83147 stersund Sweden   ______________________________________________________ $$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$  Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:  === If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 2 weeks  continue sending e-mails until you do.  === After you have received 10 orders  2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for REPORT # 2. If you do not  continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do.  ** Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report # 2  YOU CAN RELAX  because the system is already working for you  and the cash will continue to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your name is moved down on the list  you are placed in front of a different report.  You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate from this business !!! ================================================= FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM:  You have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life  with NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can make more money in the next few weeks and months than you have ever imagined. Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way. It works exceedingly well as it is now.  Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your name and address in Report #1 and moved others to #2 .....# 5 as instructed above. One of the people you send this to may send out 100 000 or more e-mails and your name will be on every one of them.   Remember though  the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach. So my friend  I have given you the ideas  information  materials and opportunity to become financially independent.  IT IS UP TO YOU NOW !  =============MORE TESTIMONIALS=============== ""My name is Mitchell. My wife  Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving 'junk mail'. I made fun of the whole thing  spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of her  and was ready to lay the old 'I told you so' on her when the thing didn't work.   Well  the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she had received total $ 147 200.00 ......... all cash! I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her 'hobby'.""  Mitchell Wolf M.D.  Chicago  Illinois ================================================ ""Not being the gambling type  it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan. But conservative as I am  I decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back. I was surprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with orders. I made $319 210.00 in the first 12 weeks.   The nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return and so big.""  Dan Sondstrom  Alberta  Canada ================================================= ""I had received this program before. I deleted it  but later I wondered if I should have given it a try. Of course  I had no idea who to contact to get another copy  so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone else......... 11 months passed then it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one! I made more than $490 000 on my first try and all the money came within 22 weeks.""  Susan De Suza  New York  N.Y. ================================================= ""It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with little cost to you. I followed the simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the money started to come in. My first month I made $20  in the 2nd month I made $560.00 and by the end of the third month my total cash count was $362 840.00. Life is beautiful  Thanx to internet.""

More testimonials later but first  =======  ==== PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE ==== $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$  If you would like to make at least $500 000 every 4 to 5 months easily and comfortably  please read the following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN!!!  $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$  FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND  YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE  GUARANTEED!  INSTRUCTIONS:  =====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below =====  For each report  send $5 CASH  THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON  YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.  ===WHEN YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER  MAKE SURE === ===YOU ORDER EACH OF THE 5 REPORTS! === You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5 = $25.00.  Within a few days you will receive  via e-mail  each of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1 000's of people who will order them from you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case something happens to your computer.  IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report  or their sequence on the list  in any way other than what is instructed below in steps 1 through 6 or you will lose out on the majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this works  you will also see how it will not work if you change it.   Remember  this method has been tested  and if you alter it  it will NOT work!!! People have tried to put their friends'/relatives' names on all five thinking they could get all the money. But it does not work this way. Believe us  some have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not try to change anything other than what is instructed. Because if you do  it will not work for you. Remember  honesty reaps the reward!!!   This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You are offering a product for sale and getting paid for it. Treat it as such and you will be VERY profitable in a short period of time.  1.. After you have ordered all 5 reports  take this advertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # 5. This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.  2.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.  3.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.  4.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.  5.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2  6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.  PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY! This is critical to YOUR success.  ================================================== **** Take this entire letter  with the modified list of names  and save it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.  Save this on a disk as well just in case you lose any data. To assist you with marketing your business on the internet  the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally  where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more. There are 2 primary methods to get this venture going:  METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY ==================================================  Let's say that you decide to start small  just to see how it goes  and we will assume you and those involved send out only 5 000 e-mails each. Let's also assume that the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much better but let's just say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only 5 000 each.  Continuing with this example  you send out only 5 000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response  that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded by sending out 5 000 e-mails each for a total of 50 000. Out of those 50 000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's 100 people who responded and ordered Report # 2.  Those 100 people mail out 5 000 e-mails each for a total of 500 000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.  Those 1000 people send 5 000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response is 10 000 orders for Report # 4.  Those 10 000 people send out 5 000 e-mails each for a total of 50 000 000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100 000 orders for Report # 5.  THAT'S 100 000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500 000.00 (half a million dollars).  Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3.....$5 000 + 4..... $50 000 + 5.... $500 000 .... Grand Total=$555 550.00  NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT  YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY! ==================================================  REMEMBER FRIEND  THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5 000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100 000 e-mails each or more?  There are over 150 million people on the internet worldwide and counting  with thousands more coming online every day. Believe me  many people will do just that  and more!  METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET ==================================================  Advertising on the net is very  very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive  all you must do is e-mail them the report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day service on all orders.  This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out  with your name and address on it  will be prompt because they cannot advertise until they receive the report.  ===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ==================== The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is illegal or somehow ""wrong"". It is simply about time. Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved  etc. Concealing it is simply so no one can SEE there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you.  ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of paper  write the NUMBER & the NAME of the report you are ordering  YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address.

If you do not  continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do.  ** Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report # 2  YOU CAN RELAX  because the system is already working for you  and the cash will continue to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your name is moved down on the list  you are placed in front of a different report.  You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate from this business !!! ================================================= FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM:  You have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life  with NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can make more money in the next few weeks and months than you have ever imagined. Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way. It works exceedingly well as it is now.  Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your name and address in Report #1 and moved others to #2 .....# 5 as instructed above. One of the people you send this to may send out 100 000 or more e-mails and your name will be on every one of them.   Remember though  the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach. So my friend  I have given you the ideas  information  materials and opportunity to become financially independent.  IT IS UP TO YOU NOW !  =============MORE TESTIMONIALS=============== ""My name is Mitchell. My wife  Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving 'junk mail'. I made fun of the whole thing  spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of her  and was ready to lay the old 'I told you so' on her when the thing didn't work.   Well  the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she had received total $ 147 200.00 ......... all cash! I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her 'hobby'.""  Mitchell Wolf M.D.  Chicago  Illinois ================================================ ""Not being the gambling type  it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan. But conservative as I am  I decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back. I was surprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with orders. I made $319 210.00 in the first 12 weeks.   The nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return and so big.""  Dan Sondstrom  Alberta  Canada ================================================= ""I had received this program before. I deleted it  but later I wondered if I should have given it a try. Of course  I had no idea who to contact to get another copy  so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone else......... 11 months passed then it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one! I made more than $490 000 on my first try and all the money came within 22 weeks.""  Susan De Suza  New York  N.Y. ================================================= ""It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with little cost to you. I followed the simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the money started to come in. My first month I made $20  in the 2nd month I made $560.00 and by the end of the third month my total cash count was $362 840.00. Life is beautiful  Thanx to internet.""

I'm ambitious but extremely lazy and I earn over $250,000 a year.  Are you curious yet?  I'll tell you my secret in a moment. It's the Internet's dirty little secret... You've probably heard stories about people making huge amounts of money online, but you thought they were CEOs of large corporations, famous programmers, or boy geniuses.  Well, grasshopper, think again... It's people like you and me who make the real money.  Yes, people like YOU AND ME!  Since the dot-com bubble burst in 1999, small business owners have become increasingly wealthy and Fortune 500 companies are looking for bankruptcy lawyers.  Today, small business owners and ordinary people like you and me can use the Internet to achieve complete financial freedom WITH NO INVESTMENT and little work.  How?  Learning the most profitable marketing technique ever created - it's called BULK EMAIL.  If you have ever received an email advertisement, you know what a bulk email is.  I bet you can't click the REMOVE button fast enough on most ads, right? You may not want their product, but remember that thousands of other people probably will.  Bulk email is a percentage game - every bulk emailer who contacts you earns a six-figure income online.  I guarantee it.  Now let's go back to math 101 and crunch some numbers... If you're selling on eBay, you're paying anywhere from a few dollars to over a hundred dollars to list a single listing.  How many people see your ad?  Maybe a few thousand, or even ten or twenty thousand in a few days.  Using bulk email, YOU CAN SEND YOUR ADVERTISEMENT TO OVER MILLIONS OF PEOPLE A DAY, at virtually no cost.  Whether you send 100,000 emails or 100 million emails, the price is the same. ZERO!  Stop paying these outrageous listing fees when almost no one sees your ad!  Imagine you have a decent product with a profit margin of $20.00 on each sale.  If you send an email ad to 500,000 people and only one person in a thousand actually places an order, then you have just generated 500 orders and made $10,000 in a few hours of work.    It's that simple... All you have to do is convince ONE PERSON OUT OF A THOUSAND to buy your stuff and you're filthy rich.  The best part is that anyone can do it.  It doesn't matter whether you're a nineteen-year-old college student using a computer in your dorm or a fifty-year-old executive working in an office building in New York.  Anyone, and I repeat ANYONE, can start sending mass emails with virtually no upfront costs.  All you need is a few days of study, a lot of ambition and basic knowledge of the Internet.  I dropped out of college at 19 to take advantage of the Dot Com mania and never looked back.  I started with no money, no product to sell, and only the most basic computer skills.  I saw an opportunity and I took it.  A few years later I bought my own house - for CASH.    You don't need any money.  You don't need the product. You don't have to be a computer geek and no experience is required.    If you saw a job advertisement like this in the newspaper, you would jump at it immediately.  It would be a dream come true. So what are you waiting for?!  I'll ask you four simple questions.  If you answer YES to all of these questions, I can almost promise you will make at least $100,000 using bulk email this year.  Here's... Do you have basic networking experience?  Do you have a computer and internet connection? Do you have a few hours of free time every day?   Do you want to earn extra money with full financial freedom in mind?    If you answer YES to these questions, you could earn anywhere from $5,000 to $20,000 a week working from home.  Say goodbye to your day job - it sure beats the 9-to-5 grind!  All you need is ambition and commitment.  This is no get-rich-quick scheme.  To make big money, you have to work, but ANYONE - and I mean ANYONE - can do it.  You're probably wondering how hard it is to get started.   Don't worry, that's not the case! I will show you step by step how to start your first email campaign and how to build a thriving online business.  You'll be generating orders and making money in less than seven days.  OK, what if you don't have anything to sell?  No problem!!  I'll show you where to find hot products that are selling like CRAAAAAZY! Most people delay starting an online business because they don't have anything to sell, but I'm removing that obstacle now.   After reading the Bulkbook, you can build a complete product line in less than two hours!  There's no excuse not to start! I'll have you ready to go within seven days. In fact… I personally guarantee that you will be starting your own massive email campaign in less than a week after reading the Bulkbook!  I will provide you with a toll-free telephone number where you can contact me 24 hours a day, seven days a week;  Where else will you find this level of service?!

This separate guide provides a daily routine you can follow, along with detailed instructions on how to get started.  For example, on your first day I will teach you where to find a product to sell.  The next day you will learn how to build a new mailing list.  On the seventh day, just click ""send""!  Your first campaign is ready to launch.

"Date: Tuesday 24 September 2002 01:31:44 +1200 Date: Tuesday 24 September 2002 01:31:44 +1200 Content transfer encoding: 8bit Hello - ( http://club.4tfox.com ) You receive emails every day an offer showing how to make money. Most of these emails come from people who are NOT making any money. And they expect you to listen to them?  Sufficiently.  If you want to make money with your computer, you should connect with a group that actually DOES it.  We make a large recurring income every month.  What's more - we will show you how to do the same.  This activity is conducted entirely via the Internet and email. You can even join for free to check it out first.  If you can send an email, you can do it.  No special ""skills"" are required.  How much do we earn?  Anywhere from $2,000 to $9,000 per month. We are real people and most of us work part-time for this company. But remember, we're WORKING on it - I'm not going to insult your intelligence by saying you can sign up, not work, and get paid.  Such a job does not exist.  But if you're willing to put in 10-12 hours a week, this might be just what you're looking for.  This is not an income that depends on luck or work done FOR you - it all depends on your effort.  But as I said, no special skills are required.  This income is residual - meaning it continues every month (and tends to increase each month).  Interested?  I invite you to find out more.  You can join as a free member at no cost and no obligation to continue if you decide it's not for you.  We're looking for people who still have that ""burning desire"" to find an opportunity that will reward them incredibly well if they work at it.  To receive your FREE ID number and for more information, simply go to http://club.4tfox.com and send me an email with the following information: ""Send me a free membership!""  Please remember to provide your: 1. First name 2. Last name 3. Email address (if different from above) We will confirm your position and send you a special report as soon as possible, as well as your free Membership Number.  If you are not interested in making money :) you are interested in a huge discount from the package of 140 Online Stores Very Cheap ISP and many, many others You can also go to the website address: http://club.4tfox.com /#id-GreatService That's all.  We will then send you the information and you can make your own decision.  I can't wait to hear from you!  Best regards, Hugh Zou P.S. After several negative experiences with network marketing companies, I basically gave up on them. This is something different - there is value integrity and a REAL opportunity to start your own home business... and finally make real money online.  Don't waste it. You can register and test the program for FREE.  All you need to do is get a free membership.  Unsubscribe: Send a blank email to deletemefromlist@bigfoot.com with ""Delete"" in the subject line.

"Date: Wednesday 25 September 2002 09:45:21 -0400 Date: Wednesday 25 September 2002 09:45:21 -0400 Content transfer encoding: 8bit Hello - ( http://club.4tfox.com ) You receive emails every day an offer showing how to make money. Most of these emails come from people who are NOT making any money. And they expect you to listen to them?  Sufficiently.  If you want to make money with your computer, you should connect with a group that actually DOES it.  We make a large recurring income every month.  What's more - we will show you how to do the same.  This activity is conducted entirely via the Internet and email. You can even join for free to check it out first.  If you can send an email, you can do it.  No special ""skills"" are required.  How much do we earn?  Anywhere from $2,000 to $9,000 per month. We are real people and most of us work part-time for this company. But remember, we're WORKING on it - I'm not going to insult your intelligence by saying you can sign up, not work, and get paid.  Such a job does not exist.  But if you're willing to put in 10-12 hours a week, this might be just what you're looking for.  This is not an income that depends on luck or work done FOR you - it all depends on your effort.  But as I said, no special skills are required.  This income is residual - meaning it continues every month (and tends to increase each month).  Interested?  I invite you to find out more.  You can join as a free member at no cost and no obligation to continue if you decide it's not for you.  We're looking for people who still have that ""burning desire"" to find an opportunity that will reward them incredibly well if they work at it.  To receive your FREE ID number and for more information, simply go to http://club.4tfox.com and send me an email with the following information: ""Send me a free membership!""  Please remember to provide your: 1. First name 2. Last name 3. Email address (if different from above) We will confirm your position and send you a special report as soon as possible, as well as your free Membership Number.  If you are not interested in making money :) you are interested in a huge discount from the package of 140 Online Stores Very Cheap ISP and many, many others You can also go to the website address: http://club.4tfox.com /#id-GreatService That's all.  We will then send you the information and you can make your own decision.  I can't wait to hear from you!  Best regards, Hugh Zou P.S. After several negative experiences with network marketing companies, I basically gave up on them. This is something different - there is value integrity and a REAL opportunity to start your own home business... and finally make real money online.  Don't waste it.

"Date: Thu. Sep 26, 2002 04:22:43 +0200 Subject: BUSINESS COOPERATION (URGENT/CONFIDENTIAL) X-Mailer: Microsoft Outlook Express 5.00.2919.6900 DM MIME version: 1.0 Content type: text/plain; charset=""us-ascii""  Dear Sir, My name is Vincent Nnaji Bank, Manager of Standard Trust Bank Lagos Nigeria. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.  On January 6, 1998, a foreign petroleum consultant, a foreign contractor from the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. James Herbert, placed a numbered twelve-calendar-month fixed deposit with my branch in the amount of US$20 million (twenty million US dollars). After reaching maturity, I sent a routine notification to his mailing address but received no response. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally learned from his contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, that Mr. James Herbert had died in a car accident.  Upon further investigation, I learned that he had died intestate and all attempts to trace his next of kin had been unsuccessful. I therefore made further inquiries and discovered that Mr. James Herbert had not named any next of kin or relatives in all of his official documents, including his bank deposit documents with my bank. This sum of $20 million was carefully transferred from my bank to the security company for safekeeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it.  Under Nigerian law, after 5 years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian government if no one files a claim for the funds. Therefore, my proposal is that I would like you, as a foreigner, to be the owner of the money that I deposited with the security company in two luggage boxes, although the security company does not know the contents of the boxes because I have marked them with photographic materials for export. I am writing to you, because as a government official I cannot maintain an offshore account or have an account worth more than $1 million.  I want to introduce you as the owner of the boxes in a security company so that you can collect them with the help of my lawyer. All this to ensure that the fruits of this old man's labor do not fall into the hands of corrupt government officials.  It's simple. Please provide your full names and address immediately so that the Attorney can prepare the necessary documents that will make you the owner of the boxes. The money will be divided 70% for me and 25% for you, and 5% will cover all expenses.  There is no risk because all formalities related to this transaction will be handled by the Representative, which will guarantee the successful implementation of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately to my private e-mail address.  Once I receive your response, I will provide more details and relevant documents to help you understand the transaction. Please maintain the utmost confidentiality and be assured that this transaction will be most beneficial for both of us as I will need your help to invest my share in your country.  I am waiting for your urgent reply via my private email to express your interest.  Thank you and best regards, MR VINCENT NNAJI.",1
"Date: Wed Sep 25, 2002 16:46:33 -0700 Content Transfer Encoding: 8-bit Dear Sir With due respect and humility I am writing this letter to you which I believe you would be very helpful to my children and me. contact through my husband's business address book and I believed that you must be a trustworthy and reliable person who, after hearing this news, would not want to intimidate me or betray my trust. I am from KONOBO in KEREMA Local County, SIERRA LEONE, West Africa and am the wife of the late DR. MUNDI A. KOJO who was murdered by rebels forced to be loyal to Major John Paul Koromah because he was the CEO of the Sierra Leone National Gold and Diamond Mining Corporation. A few days before my husband was assassinated, he ordered me and my children (Ibrahim and Amina) to move out of Sierra Leone, just before the powerful forces of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOMOG) intervened, which ultimately led to a brutal civil war. My children and I managed to escape to Togo thanks to the help of my husband's friend. We arrived in Togo with valuables including the sum of $25 MILLION (TWENTY-FIVE MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS ONLY) in two boxes which I deposited with a trust company here in Togo and made a special arrangement with a courier company that will transport the money to your country. Meanwhile, I want to leave Togo entirely with this money to invest in your country because of the stable political situation there and, above all, because of the future of my children. Please help me obtain this fund from the trust company at any of its branches in Europe, after which it will be deposited into your account for investment in your country. You should also help us find good investment opportunities so that we can invest wisely in your country once the fund is finally confirmed in your account. We intend to reward you handsomely for your help because we have decided to give you 20% of the total amount for your help. However, since I am being monitored by secret agents of the Sierra Leone government, I advise you to make a deal with my son (IBRAHIM KOJO). Please contact my son at this email address: ibrahimkojo@caramail.com immediately after receiving this letter so that we can seriously proceed to receive the parcels and send them to your account. Your private fax and telephone are needed in this transaction for private conversations.  Please note: this activity does not involve any risk.  Be blessed, Lady. ANNA KOJO",1

I also believe that you will not reveal or betray the trust I intend to build with you. It is with great joy and personal respect that I have decided to contact you.  Well, I am VICTOR SANKOH, son of Mr. FODAYA ​​SANKOH who was arrested by ECOMOG PEACE KEEPING FORCE a few months ago in my country, Sierra Leone. A few days before my father's arrest, he confided in me and ordered me to go to his underground safe and move out immediately, upon presentation of a deposit agreement and a cash receipt that he had issued to a security company in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, where he had deposited one iron box containing 22 millions of dollars in cash (twenty-two million dollars).  This money was earned from the sale of gold and diamonds by my FATHER and before his arrest he had already decided to use this money for future family investments.  Then I ran with these documents to Abidjan and confirmed that my father had submitted the box. The government of Côte d'Ivoire also granted me political residence as a refugee.  In the meantime, my father told me to look for a trusted foreigner to help me immediately transport this money out of Côte d'Ivoire for investment. On this basis, I am asking for help in transferring these funds to your account, but I will require the following requirements: (1) Could you provide me with a safe bank account to which these funds will be transferred in your country or another nearby country where taxes will not be high? money?  (2) Could you please help me get travel documents after this transfer so that I can come to your country to invest this money?  (3) Could you introduce me to a profitable business venture that would not require much technical knowledge in your country where part of this fund will be invested?  Please, all these requirements are urgently needed because they will enable me to establish a stronger business relationship with you, which is why I would like you to be the general supervisor of the investment later. I am a Christian and I would like you to conduct this transaction based on the trust I have placed in you.  For your help in this transaction, I have decided to offer you a 12% commission on the total amount at the end of this transaction. The security of this company is very important to me and therefore I would like you to treat this matter very confidentially. I will be waiting for your urgent reply. Thank you and God bless you.

Actions & indications: Simultaneous  High-Spirited; ""Stimulation / Relaxation / Aphrodisia"" (Significant Paradise Consequence!)  This is the Personal Choice  Sensitive  Responsive Smoking (""Smoka"") product we have wanting to offer! This is the product and the VALUE that you have been searching for. This is the product that you will buy again & again!  We have been in the business (science) of developing non-cannabis  personal choice sensitive smoking agendas for a good  goodly while. Along this avenue of ethnobotany  we have always strived to achieve greater and greater ""Sensitivity / Responsiveness"" & Aphrodisia within our gourmet smokables and brews. And indeed  we have. Many of these previous products are still marketed today by companies who are less developmental than our botanical resource cooperative. Even our own two signature ""smokables"" (Ragga Dagga & Stoney Mahoney) are being discontinued. That Shangrila Zowie Wowie is by far such a superior product is undeniable  therefore it makes no sense to us at all to offer any other smoking product. Quite simply we have surpassed even our own expectations of excellence  thereby; our definition of excellence has evolved. This ""Shangrila"" project has been in research and development for sometime on two fronts. First  on an agricultural level  fields for our Gnarly SweetGrass!  must be planted and be allowed to propagate for several years before initial harvest can even be undertaken. This is how the botanical achieves ""potent significance"" much like the regimen of ginseng. Also  harvest time is limited and can take place only twice a year  as like the hemp plant  maximum potency is only achieved after ""flowering"" occurs. But  unlike the hemp plant  and for that matter  unlike most herbs  the entire base plant of Shangrila Zowie Wowie (leave  stem & root) is all ""viripotent "" which makes this ""gnarly stoke"" a botanical phenomenon! As well  most potentiating factors of Shangrila  as well as the primary botanical factor of Shangrila  will not achieve ""viripotency"" if grown in our hemisphere  therefore; Shangrila is indeed a multi-national  multi-complicated  agricultural undertaking. However  all of this undertaking has indeed been worthwhile! Secondly  the potentiating  infusion regimen used to enhance the attributes of Shangrila has also taken a lon! g time to bring into potent fruition as there are many balancings of the various molecular factors involved in the completion of Zowie Wowie. We are most pleased to be able to say  as you will note in the experience of Shangrila Zowie Wowie  that this process has achieved fruition.  Suffice to say  without any hype or glype  Shangrila Zowie Wowie Gnarly SweetGrass is without a doubt  the most significant  non-invasive  non-cannabis  ""sensitive/responsive""  personal choice  absolutely legal (cannot fail a drug test)  smoking (""Smoka"") botanical on our planet ... probably in the universe! Hard to believe that this product is ABSOLUTELY LEGAL!  * Mill-stoned & honed. * Depressive regressive! * Psychologically uplifting! * Good-bye stress  anxiety & restlessness! * Sophisticated  well-balanced ""ambiance."" * Inspires contemplativeness and creativity. * ""Potentiated"" & viripotent! * 4  5 draws lasts a good  goodly while. * Sweet aphrodisia! (Horny Goat Weed factoring) * Simultaneously; uplifting and relaxing! * Easy ignition  Smooth draw  Sweet  heady taste. * Easy on  easy off! * SATISFACTION GUARANTEED! * No ""munchie"" factor. * No failed drug tests!  Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) Gnarly ""SweetGrass"" botanical is best utilized as a viri-potent ""Smoka""  via an herb-pipe. As is an herbalist's way  four or five draws of ""Smoka"" should be inhaled and retained. For the non-smoker  it is most appropriate to engage this herbaceousness as a potentiated tea/brew. (Steep approximately one teaspoon of Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) herba per one cup of water for ten minutes or so & strain.) When smoking Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm)  please draw gently as it is a most preeminent ""Sensitive / Responsive"" Smoke. Both a personal water-pipe (huuka) (water-pipe is included with quarter pound can only) and a standard herb-pipe are included for your smoking convenience and delight. Smoke and Brew concurrently is absolutely a Sweet  Sensitive Treat!  Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) ""Sensitive/Responsive"" Smoka includes and is potentiated with the following non-irradiated  Mill-Stoned & Honed  exotica botanicals and botanical essences: Half-edged Lily-rare Bian Lian (lobeline factors)  Kona Lactuca virosa  Yucatan Turnera aphrodisaca  Hawaiian Vervain (Maui strain)  Siberian Leonorus Sibricus  rare Lotus Leaf  Jamaican Blue Verbena officinalis  Spanish Peumus Crocus Sativa  Chinese (flowering-tops only) Horny Goat Weed  Ginko Biloba  African Cola Vera  and African Wilde Dagga (flowering-tops only).

This Prosaka formulation  which we have just recently further potentiated  boasts an extremely loyal and abundant patronage  having been available to market at large now for a number of years. Prosaka botanical tablets were originally introduced as a botanical  supplemental alternative to various traditional medications that are prescribed for stress  anxiety  depressiveness  mood enhancement  insomnia  excessive dream activity  etc. We like to use this analogy: Imagine the circumstances of your life to be hurricane-ish. Certainly  Prosaka will not stop the wind from blowing. However  it will help to center you within the calm eye of your hurricane  so that you will better see your living and make your decisions from a calmer  more serene  more balanced perspective. Please note that when undertaking any supplemental herbal regimen in this arena  it is important to make a personal commitment to the therapy. It would make no sense to purchase Prosaka and to take it only sporadic! ally or only briefly. It is for this reason  although Prosaka is a very expensive formulation to produce; that we offer 300 count containers at as much of a reduced price as we are able to offer.  Prosaka is an exclusive  proprietary amalgamation in tablet form which includes the following uncommon botanicals  extracts  flower-top essences and essential oils: Radix Salviae  Sensitive Mimosa Bark  Arillus Euphoriae  Shizandra  Frutcus Mori  Caulis Polygoni  Zizyohus  Tang Kuei  Cedar Seed  Sweetflag Rhizome  Cuscutae  Amber  Radix Scutellariae  Evodia  Longan  Arisaema  Cistanches  Radix Polygalae  Red Sage Root and Eucommia. No factor contained within Prosaka is restricted or regulated by law. All botanicals contained within are non-irradiated and are of pharmaceutical grade.   Suggested Usage: 1 - 2 tablets; 2 to 3 times per day as needed. Best taken on an empty stomach. (During times of intensity up to 10 tablets per day may be utilized.)
