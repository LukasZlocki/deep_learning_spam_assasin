The officers seized an automatic rifle the man was carrying  then the man got out of the truck and was taken into custody  NTV said. No other details were immediately available. The man had demanded talks with high government officials  the Interfax and ITAR-Tass news agencies said. Ekho Moskvy radio reported that he wanted to talk with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Police and security forces rushed to the Security Service building  within blocks of the Kremlin  Red Square and the Bolshoi Ballet  and surrounded the man  who claimed to have one and a half tons of explosives  the news agencies said. Negotiations continued for about one and a half hours outside the building  ITAR-Tass and Interfax reported  citing witnesses. The man later drove away from the building  under police escort  and drove to a street near Moscow's Olympic Penta Hotel  where authorities held further negotiations with him  the Moscow police press service said. The move appeared to be an attempt by security services to get him to a more secure location.   ------------------------ Yahoo!

The officers seized an automatic rifle the man was carrying  then the man got out of the truck and was taken into custody  NTV said. No other details were immediately available. The man had demanded talks with high government officials  the Interfax and ITAR-Tass news agencies said. Ekho Moskvy radio reported that he wanted to talk with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Police and security forces rushed to the Security Service building  within blocks of the Kremlin  Red Square and the Bolshoi Ballet  and surrounded the man  who claimed to have one and a half tons of explosives  the news agencies said. Negotiations continued for about one and a half hours outside the building  ITAR-Tass and Interfax reported  citing witnesses. The man later drove away from the building  under police escort  and drove to a street near Moscow's Olympic Penta Hotel  where authorities held further negotiations with him  the Moscow police press service said. The move appeared to be an attempt by security services to get him to a more secure location.   ------------------------ Yahoo!

The officers seized an automatic rifle the man was carrying  then the man got out of the truck and was taken into custody  NTV said. No other details were immediately available. The man had demanded talks with high government officials  the Interfax and ITAR-Tass news agencies said. Ekho Moskvy radio reported that he wanted to talk with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Police and security forces rushed to the Security Service building  within blocks of the Kremlin  Red Square and the Bolshoi Ballet  and surrounded the man  who claimed to have one and a half tons of explosives  the news agencies said. Negotiations continued for about one and a half hours outside the building  ITAR-Tass and Interfax reported  citing witnesses. The man later drove away from the building  under police escort  and drove to a street near Moscow's Olympic Penta Hotel  where authorities held further negotiations with him  the Moscow police press service said. The move appeared to be an attempt by security services to get him to a more secure location.   ------------------------ Yahoo!
